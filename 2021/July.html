			<h2 id="07202021"><a href="#07202021">7/20/2021</a> - Connecting some dots in the bullet shortage.</h2>
			<h3>Looking into product shortages and their causes in different industries, to better understand the world, brings up the recent bullet shortage.</h3> 
			<p>Part of it is nothing new - <a href="https://www.19fortyfive.com/2021/01/bullet-shortage-why-ammo-prices-are-going-sky-high/">there's a surge of sales during liberal presidencies</a>. This is a known and expected situation for gun sellers. And prepping is hoarding - some gun owners have several 500-round cases stored. And some will <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/growing-idaho/shell-ammo-shortage-bites-industry-guns-firearms/277-88a06712-3c39-4f90-ac33-8b8aaf46b591">buy 15,000 rounds in one purchase.</a> But they might use 100-500 rounds on a weekend for fun, or 1000 a day while preparing for a competition.</p> 
			<p>Part of it is odd - Bullets are somewhat simple, and some shooters press their own, even <a href="https://www.gunsamerica.com/digest/reloading-primers/">reloading old shells</a>. The ingredients are easy to make and get - except primers. <a href="https://blog.thebestshootingsite.com/2021/02/19/is-the-ammunition-shortage-real-or-manufactured/">The bullet shortage is really a primer shortage.</a></p>
			<p>Primers are hit by the firing pin, and ignite the explosive inside. <a href="https://aardvarkreloading.com/resources/homemadeprimercourse.pdf">They contain an extremely small amount of an extremely dangerous explosive</a>, held together by shellac. And they're all still made by hand.</p> 
			<p>And Remington used to be a major supplier. They were owned by Cerberus (who also own Burger King, that's their deal, owning random businesses) when Sandy Hook happened. And then a lot of their shareholders pushed to sell Remington, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/why-did-remington-go-bankrupt-the-gun-company-might-want-to-look-to-trump-8600992">which they did by loading Remington up with debt.</a> The old Leveraged Buyout, driven here by the tragedy, and not market whims, but the outcome was the same: Remington went bankrupt in March 2018.</p> 
			<p>Remington's branches got snatched by various others. <a href="https://www.shootingsportsretailer.com/news/breakup-plans-announced-for-remington-arms-and-its-associated-companies">Vista Outdoor got their ammo branch</a>, and are arguably <a href="https://blog.thebestshootingsite.com/2021/02/19/is-the-ammunition-shortage-real-or-manufactured">causing the primer shortage</a>. Rumor goes that they are doing it for fun and profit.</p>
			<p>Ironically, some blame Trump for "stifling industry profits" at this key time, as Remington might have barely been able to survive if propped up by the tide-like surge during a Democratic administration.</p> 
			<p>And so industry inaction about gun regulation is actually impacting the supply of industry products.</p>
