['Concerns about AI already being able to predict public opinion, and this power getting into the wrong hands.','li'],
['Concerns about AI that are instantly addictive to a given human, and can be trained to be irresistible to specific individuals.','li'],
['Proposal to make AI companies exempt from a Copyright law named "Section 230", which would make them partially responsible for harm caused by their products.','li'],
['Request for risk-based regulation from industry - saying that AI regulation needs its own government agency, probably an international agency, as a USA-only agency would be pointless and just force dubious AI companies to move elsewhere. Not sure which international agency would enforce this, but a need is there.','li'],
['Proposal to control AI use through GPU export access.','li'],

['Analogy to automobiles as new tech, creating numerous federal agencies to regulate cars.','li'],
['Not regulating social media called a mistake.','li'],
['Need agency-growing experts. Also need science to be a key part of regulation - we don\'t have science terms to describe misinformation and tech to detect it in an AI.','li'],
