If your pronouns exist to be a hammer to hit others over the head with, then I won't use them. 
90% of people who use pronouns are using obvious pronous. 

Get more nines by multiplying these nines together. But the 80/20 rule suggests that we can get 80% of the result for 20% of the effort, and by doubling this we can get 2x80% solutions for ~45% of the effort, giving a sometimes-complete solution. In this way the 80/20 rule gives a 4x multple onto these nines.

	["Combined with the above means that water becomes less humid as it warms, without changing the quantity of water molecules, or their ratio to other air molecules, such as dinitrogen or dioxygen. Likewise, water becomes more humid as it cools. The dew point is where the temperature will drop to the point where humidity goes above 100%, and water begins to condense - on everything, including the dust in the air.","p"],
	["4. Clouds are accumuations of water molecules around dust particles, suspended by other air molecules.","h2"],
	["Clouds occur in places where the humidity approaches 100%. They stick together due to water's polar magnetic configuration - but water molecules in air move too fast to stick together. So they clump on dust particles in the air. A cloud's high albedo is due to Mie Radiation, where their molecule size being approximately the same as visible light means it reflects the light very well. ","p"],

["Rain and climate change","p"],
["One of the impacts of global warming that was not foreseen was how Earth air expands to hold more water as it warms. Rain is basically dew condensing on dirt in the air - rain seeding is dumping special condensing dust into humid air. And as October gets slightly hotter, it takes a few more days for Earth's atmosphere and upper crust to cool below the dew point every fall. This is compounded by the enzymes in plants being raised above their ignition temperature.  As these get worse, stores, malls, and other enclosed spaces with filtered air become more attractive. Another burgeoning industry could be filtered air tents, for huge gatherings like family reunions or corporate events, on parks and other outdoor places during forest fire season.","p"],

This could lead to high loading times, if many clients are waiting to load a user's avatar from a blockchain. Not to mention very high blockchain storage and network rates, relative to conventional hardware.

["Electron clouds - The planetary electron model was developed in 1952, disproven in 1954, but still used today to inaccurately describe electron clouds to laypeople. Indeed, the \"N=137 problem\" uses this inaccurate model to say that atoms with atomic numbers above 136 wouldn't be physically possible, as having the electrons race around such large orbital rings would require that they exceed lightspeed. We have only generated Oganesson (N=118) in 2002 and (since odd numbers of N are much less stable) Tennessine (N=117) in 2016, and work is on to reach 120 - so we won't have theoretical information on N=137 for some time."],

They may decide to \"die on this hill\" and \"go down with their ship\" over a moral cause instead of fulfilling my transaction. Chick-Fil-A makes a moral stance part of their advertising, which asks the question if they are prejudiced towards a certain group, how can we trust them to fairly evaluate the inputs from that group - will they take contaminated product from a human merely because they fit Chick-Fil-A's vision of a moral human? Since they consider this moral imperative more important than their profits (the moral imperative of fiduciary responsibility to shareholders), then will they hold it superior to the moral imperitave of following laws? I have no reason to trust that they would not. The same for Hobby Lobby and others - we can expect that they will have an inferior product selection based on the fact that they're excluding part of their potential supply sources, and corporate prejudices drive a high probability of excluding potentially valuable sales for no finanical reason.

After a few tries, I built a second version with scaffolding in the frame, reinforcing the triangular elements. This greatly increases the print quality and success. A third version included a reinforcing pyramid at every corner, and this allowed one 5 g cube to hold almost 20 lbs, or 9000 grams. The fourth version introduced interlocking pegs and gaps, and the 5th further reinforced the corners.\",\"\",\"p\")"],
