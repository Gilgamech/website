addElement("0118Bubble","Why do so many senior US politicians store classified or sensitive documents in their homes? This has been a major controversy spanning at least the past 3 Presidential terms. Yet the two political sports teams can only see it happening in the other team's dugout. So nobody actually wants to solve the problem, just prevent the other side from batting.","","p")
addElement("0118Bubble","Referring to a Gillogsim: 'Members of one political party will intentionally hurt themselves during the other party's turn, so they can truthfully say that people got hurt during the other party's turn. Like if the Dodgers were hosting the Astros, and during the bottom of every inning, a bunch of Astros fans started a fight, every inning, until the 5th inning when security cleared out a huge chunk of the stands. And the Astros fans did this so they could talk about how unsafe it is when the Dodgers are at bat, because of all the fights in the stands - therefore the Dodgers shouldn't be allowed to bat anymore, and only the Astros should bat. Where's the political equivalent of unsportspersonlike conduct? Ethics lol. Where's the political equivalent of a fiduciary?'","","p")
