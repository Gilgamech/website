# [09/28/2028](#09282028) - Getting Biblical with your rainfall.
## If the Biblical Flood were the Younger Dryas Flood:
### Story says they loaded up their Ark (basically yacht) with food and animals.
### Rained for 40 days straight.
- Flooding wasn't from a tsunami (so not like the Lake Missoula 'walls of water' flooding nor the supposed tsunami that one YT video said overtook Atlantis.
- Some theories suggest a solar or asteroid source ending the ice age suddenly and causing the flood - if the kilometer of ice over Canada were vaporized all at once, how much water would this put into the air? This would of course be over 100% humidity (which is a few gallons in a house) and rain heavily. 
### Released a bird every day, but the bird always came back to the boat since there was nowhere else to land. Until one day, the bird didn't come back, and soon the Ark found the tree it landed on.
- The implication is that the entire Earth were covered with an identical world-wide flood situation.
- Trees won't last 40 days underwater, let alone 140 to 160 - they'll suffocate and/or drown.
- The tree had to be at a very high point - a tall hill, if not a short mountain.
- This implies that there were some mountain peaks that were not flooded. Possibly even lower.
- The Biblical account likely retells a regional Mediterranean flood experience. Need more 'flood story anthropology' to know for sure - need to line up hard points such as durations and situations.
### Parts of some continents were likely covered in dozens or hundreds of feet of standing water, which would need like 1/3 of a year to flood down rivers and into oceans.
- Genesis 7.11: rainfall starts on the 'second month, the seventeenth day of the month'
- Genesis 8.4: ark makes landfall 'seventh month, the seventeenth day of the month'
- So was adrift for 5 months total. Now the question is: whose month, and how long was it? No indications for calendar, month name, or season is given.
- Starting with a simple lunar month, as solar calendars hadn't been invented yet. 5x28 = 140. (Or maybe this was far enough back that a previous society had their own solar calendar?)
- Hebrew Calendar was available back then, and months have 29-30 days. 5x29.5 = 147.5
- This would imply that the 2nd month is Iyar (May-June) and the 7th month is Tishrei (Sept-Oct)
- Alternate suggestion is that it's based off Noah's birthday. So like if he were born in Jul, then 2nd month would be Sept and 7th month would be Feb. (This supposedly happened in the 600th year of Noah's life.)
### How many inches of rain can fall in a day? Were we talking 'Year of rain in a day' kind of rainfall?
- Seattle gets an average of 37.7 inches of rainfall per year, while Las Vegas gets closer to 4. The reason the recent tropical storm was so impactful is that it rained 0.85 inches per day - this would be a heavy regular rainstorm in Seattle.
- Levant region gets about 25 inches and Egypt gets 0.79 to 7.87.
### Assuming currents push it in a constant direction, how far can a yacht drift in 5 months?
- Multiply the speed of the current plus half of the wind speed in mph, times the hours that you will be sleeping for. C x .5W x H
- This is limited by the unknown currents from a temporary body of water, with unknown wind. It could have been spinning around the same area for much of the ~140 days, not unlike Moses leading a 40-year tour of a stretch of desert traversable in 2 weeks. 
### So 40 days of rain and about 100-120 days of drifting to reach a West Asian mountain range.
- The end location was Mount Ararat, at the far end of the Mediterranean Sea.
- Currents and winds would be unknown during this rare weather event, preventing much mathematical analysis.
- But were this Younger Dryas, it would be caused by the release of ice covering Canada - flooding eastward across the Atlantic Ocean and into the Mediterranean.
- This implies that Noah were living much further west, possibly in modern Spain or Morocco, but probably still along the Mediterranean.
- The rainfall that Noah recorded might have been caused by vaporized glacier condensing as rainfall - torrential rain flash flooding for over a month could have been supplemented by drastically rising local sea levels due to an influx of freed glacial water.
- These same glaciers were sending walls of water westwards over Washington State, from Lake Missoula.

# [09/21/2022](#09212022) - Neural Networks part 6: Culture is King.
AI are for content like those crypto currency money launderers like Tornado Cash. The idea is to throw everyone's stuff in a blender, and everyone gets to take out what they want, and that belongs to them. At first, this starts to sound like Swinging, a Liberal married person's game. But keep going and it all just starts to sound like communism - the incomplete collection of ideals masquerading as an economic system, where everyone is an identical, fungible blob, nobody knows anything, and everyone's wholly dependent on the government.
That paragraph starts to sound like an extension of De Tocqueville's observations that were written by George Orwell. A sick end-game of capitalism and free markets where only the ultra-rich cabal of elite politicians, tech boards, and A-list celebrities have any money or influence, and we're all their serfs - owning nothing and just happy that they haven't decided to remove us yet.

# [09/03/2022](#09032022) -  The Stiffening
- From a video (put link here later.)
## Object failure modes:
- Global buckling is mostly a function of length but also of area moment and material modulus (stiffness)
- Local buckling depends on B/T ratios of local section elements. (B = width or middle dimension, T = thickness or shortest dimension.)
- Axial resistance is lumped into buckling susceptibility since area and length are held constant. 
- Torsion resistance is how much twisting a piece can take before internal shear or excessive rotation, and depends on torsion constant J, which bascially measures enclosed internal area. 
- Symmetry simplifies ease of manufacturing while increasing the axes of load. More symmetric has more repeatable patterns
- Workability is fewer of faces and vertices, and more points for positive connectivity. Also stiffness.
- Positive connectivity means it can support loads in any direction.
## Shapes
- I-beam
  - Strong and stiff on primary axis 
  - Symmetry on 2 axes, but 1 is weaker than the other, necessitating wide flanges (crossbars) to increase stiffness in the neutral axis.
  - High B/T ratios increase buckling susceptibility. 
  - Web buckle from concentrated load along primary axis.
  - Flange buckle from lateral loads. 
  - Low torsion resistance due to low enclosed area, and no continuous area far from the neutral axis.
- Square Filled
  - Okay at torsion
  - Otherwise much like I-beam
- Square Hollow
  - Great at torsion
  - Otherwise much like filled.
- Circle Filled
  - Minimum B/T as it's a constant diameter circle.
  - Okay torsion resistance.
- Circle Hollow
  - Taking same area as filled and spreading it into a circle gives a higher area moment (and thus bending resistance).
  - Great at resisting torsion as they have a continuous area far from the shape's center, to resist twisting loads.
  - Thin walls can cause local buckling issues.
  - Ideal for resisting internal fluid pressures, as there's no edges for local pressure to build up.
  - Poor bending resistance because area isn't far from neutral axis.
  - Needs special connectors.
- Channel
  - I-beam split down primary axis. 
  - Only part of I-beam bending resistance
  - Shares torsion and buckling flaws of I-beam 
  - Flanges on one side greatly improves workability, due to nesting giving positive connectivity.
- T-beam
  - I-beam split down neutral axis. 
  - Has some benefits of I-beams but can't take lateral loading or load reversal.
  - Flat side greatly improves workability.
- Angle
  - 1/2 of a T-beam
  - Not favorable for bending or torsion, as they have the downsides of I-beams without the downsides.
  - Axis of symmetry is diagonal, so isn't usually useful. 
  - Can be combined into Ts or Zs to improve workability.
