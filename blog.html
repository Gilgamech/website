<!-- Cryptid currency
- Formal
Lack of oversight allows market players to create volatility, and whole new currencies, at will. Market players set up and run countryless central banks as though they're businesses, including the massive marketing budgets to name sports stadiums. There is no consumer nor employee protection, so during downturns both parties are among the first to be pushed from the company. 
- ForEx
Volatile and not backed make it like investing in the Turkish Lira through a Chinese bank. (Investing in the RMB through a Turkish bank would be a less-questionable investment strategy. Even better, for those with the option, is investing in USD through an US American bank.)
- Marketing
Each new currency, and each wave of an existing currency, uses the marketing budget of a Disney movie. (Pay Youtubers to say "to the moon" a lot.)
- Environment
In 2022, most electricity on Earth is generated through carbon release and not a sustainable power source, and so the high electricity use of these devices (comparable to heating Sweden through the arctic winter) must be having a high environmental impact.
- ROI
Consumes enormous amounts of very expensive computational resources for questionable ROI, using electricity consumption comparable to Sweden. 
Asset classes are entirely numerical hashes, for which an algorithmic hash-to-image function has been constructed - these people don't even own those ugly monkeys, as the monkey is just a drawing that a website makes based on the random-ish numbers that the person bought. Just like Robohash.com can do with any username.
- Computational
Reverse-engineering SHA256 (or similar) certificates to store data feels like a solution in search of a problem. Why not reverse-engineer SSL certificates or user passwords? SHA isn't technically reversible, so they're creating billions of certs per second, looking for one that already has the transaction details hashed within. And the more people looking, the harder it becomes to find.
- Utility
Markets often overinflates with speculative investors, causing too much volatility for the currency to be used for payment, and definitely too "interesting" to reliably store asset value. 
In which situations do you need a volunteer-distributed append-only database that's weak against a 51% attack?
More miners, instead of creating proportionately more capacity in the system, instead have the same capacity divided across them, causing miners to compete instead of creating more liquidity in the system just when you need it. This causes supply-side inflation, where high demand for the currency inflates its value unnaturally. Therefore it cannot store value, since transfer rates will always inflate alongside coin prices - an effective store of value has a low or static fee instead of this Adjustable Rate.
- Psychological
"Winning" a block has a very gacha feel, and the "line/number go up" effect is undeniable. (This effect is pronounced on highways as "car go forward", leading to both speeding and people scooting up on red lights - to tell the red light to hurry up.)
Users are eager to look at ugly monkeys because they're a nice change of pace from the bar and line graphs. (This is the News Advertising cycle being played out in crypto)
- Market effects
Impacts gaming as both consume the same video cards. (Weren't ASICs supposed to help with this? Yeah but why buy an ASIC - if this currency goes bust you could go play Elden Ring instead.)
- Career
Giving a "cash prize" for performing work is much less ethical than having a labor contract, turning mining into the Gig Economy version of Data Centers. 
Company employees experience rug-pulls during market downturns, since their employers sole value is psychological, and the industry has but one revenue stream: investors. 
- Industry
These are quintessential tech companies in a few ways, including their heavy use of scalable code, investor-driven Ponziesque profit model (where is the ad-supported Bitcon?), and disregard for employees with highly-valuable skills by treating them as disposable.
There are no profit centers here, only cost centers.

				<h2 id="07292022"><a href="#07292022">07/29/2022</a> - Making websites about making websites.</h2>
				<p>Part of becoming a solutions architect is endless learning. There are So Many Services. And more than half of them are AWS. So I'm assembling a website to keep track of them all. Right now it's called <a href="http://offeringoverview.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/SES">Offering Overview</a>. It's still a work in progress, so please be gentle.</p>
				</div><br><br>

				<h2 id="07282022"><a href="#07282022">07/28/2022</a> - For the love of webservice.</h2>
				<p>Containers led down a rabbit hole that reignited my love of full stack development. I created a <a href="https://github.com/Gilgamech/ProgrammaticWebserver">Programmatic Webserver</a>, to which you can PUT a JSON file with an action described, and the server will respond accordingly when GET is called against the same resource.</p>
				<p>Alongside this has been much studying of cloud architecture and evaluating numerous products. A Gartner image reposted on LinkedIn gave me an epiphany about the state and direction of the industry. Look forward to more content about how patching servers is a waste of time in the age of serverless and SaaS, and how much more we can do if we're so unburdened.</p>
				<p>Also cleaned up my <a href="https://github.com/Gilgamech">Github</a> pages, uploading and fixing up numerous repos including the 3d <a href="https://github.com/Gilgamech/ShapeCache">ShapeCache</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Gilgamech/WebCoif">WebCoif</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Gilgamech/starspar">StarSpar</a>, plus <a href="https://github.com/Gilgamech/ARKData">ARKData</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Gilgamech/SteamQuery">SteamQuery</a>.</p>
				<p>The site is back now as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html">hosted S3 files</a>, fronted by a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/">CloudFront distribution</a>. The SSL certificate was generated by ACM after manual DNS modifications. </p>
				<p>Tips: </p><ul>
				<li>Be sure to specify your index.html or other root file - leave it blank and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44741287/cloudfront-error-this-xml-file-does-not-appear-to-have-any-style-information-as">CloudFront will accelerate an S3 error page</a>.</li> 
				<li>Remember to add your main domain as an alternate CNAME domain, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/resolve-cloudfront-bad-request-error/">CloudFront won't be able to find it, and will instead give you a 403 error</a>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A big plus to moving to S3 is the ease of updating individual files - almost as easy as when it was on a Windows server. Next up, we'll evaluate costs.</p>
