Since 1994, province and city governments have to pay for their own social services, but can't take out loans, and have to pass most taxes straight through to their national government. LGFVs meet the financing need, where province and city governments get land (through eminent domain? or they buy the farmer's lease?) and gift it to the LGFV for no cost nor tax. Then the LGFV leverages or sells the land to generate profits, which are gifted back to the LGFV's local government. LGFV loans are counted as private debt, not government debt, and so isn't tracked as easily. Estimates put this at 30% of local government revenue aka 40% of GDP, about 30 trillion yuan ($4.21 trillion). Land sales falling by 72% lowered local government revenue by 20%.

- In USA 2008, prices were still increasing as people defaulted, so they could still sell the house. 
- In China 2022, prices collapsed before people started defaulting, so they can't effectively sell. 

BRI projects suffer the same half-done situation as the tofu buildings. 

So the CCP let this bubble grow by not requiring developer audits, then accidentally cuts off developers with the 3 red lines, causing the developers to default on other loans. This caused developer credit ratings to tumble to where bondholders, banks and buyers won't touch them. And the CCP's response is their usual carrot-and-disappear, forcing developers to scramble to be one of the lucky few to pass the audits and receive the precious government loans needed to restart work and avoid jail time. This is not only needlessly penalizing, but also disregards market impact of the bailouts - it's possible that these bailouts could be wildly successful and that the market could still entirely tank, since the largest developers are probably also the least likely to pass the audits. Almost like instead of Too Big To Fail, it's Too Big Goto Jail. It's Jack Ma all over again, but with so much more lost face for the CCP. 

XJP demands local govs meet growth targets, so they loosen both restrictions on developer and buyer borrowing, only to have their central gov demand these be reverted within 24 hours. This essentially turns into a prison sentence for the leaders of those local govs. 



- Local governments need to sell land to retain LGFV investor confidence, by maintaining a large enough revenue stream to support or bail out the LGFV. 
- LGFVs (58.5%) have overtaken other sources (41.5%) as the main revenue source for local governments, funding this by taking out loans and bonds with other national(ized) companies and banks. 
Isn't this a governmental Ponzi scheme? 
- Prices need to continue to rise, to increase local government profits from land sales, so LGFVs can sell properties for higher in the future, justifying their current borrowing. 
Is this cyclical or structural? Structural would be hitting a fundamental limit, like everyone who can long-term lease an apartment has done so. Because a person can only live in one apartment, especially in travel-restrictive China. One clue to this is the recent reversal of the one-apartment policy into a strong suggestion to buy several. Cyclical would imply being tied to a seasonal, business, or recession cycle, and while we are entering a recession cycle, a strong housing market doesn't really see strong cyclical downturns like this. Construction is time consuming, so housing demand tends to be somewhat inelastic and constant.

Instead, this is a dystopian cyberpunk nightmare where regulations are a memory and no cloud provider can be trusted. On the surface, this means expecting your storage to actively copy your data, expecting your network to inject malware, and expecting your compute source to modify or add commands.","","p")
addElement("1022Bubble","It's cheaper and easier to not need to trust. Trust has 2 levels: that it works at all, and that it works correctly. The service has to be somewhere on a spectrum from incompetent to evil, assuming this is a profit-seeking situation. Further implications will reveal themselves as we dig deeper. On the way will be intersections with serverless website hosting, left shifting, and more. Grab your bit bucket and let's get started.","","p")

addElement("1022Bubble","Incoming connections must be restricted by address and port at all points - internet to cloud, cloud to OS, OS to application. Encrypting data before storing in databases et cetera is preferred, with info like usernames, street addresses, credit cards being randomish strings within the data structure, and only decrypted on the client's device. Databases should be password-protected and tables should be restricted to specific accounts. If possible, the database files should be encrypted at rest as well. Client updates would be encrypted before being transmitted and stored.","","p")
addElement("1022Bubble","Authentication mechanisms should rotate bearer tokens more frequently - on every request if possible. Use an algorithm for the client to transform the bearer token for return, to prevent direct sniffing reuse.","","p")

addElement("1022Bubble","Compute isn't always necessary - you'll always have some flat files. And compute doesn't have to happen on the hostile host - it can happen on the client's device. You don't worry about the client's device being hostile - that's the user's problem. You don't need to trust anonymous client GETs, obviating this whole section. And this is the intersection with serverless hosting.","","p")
addElement("1022Bubble","When compute IS necessary, we return to the choice of security vs the trifecta. Compute logic is more secure when contained within a hardened container such as Bottlerocket, and even moreso within a hardened VM.

So assuming these are the old Dell or HP industry workhorse 2U rackmount server, this would all fit nicely into 1/2 rack. Ongoing Operations lists racks as still between $1000-$1500 per month.","","p")
addElement("1007Bubble","At a previous employer, back in 2014, we had 40 million unique users/month across 4 large (24 core) and 6 small (4 core) webservers, one large (24 core) SQL server, and a few utility servers - spread across 7 Sabey cabinets but could have squeezed into 3. We were paying $1500/month/cabinet, which included electricity and cooling but not Internet.","","p")

Additionally S3 has a bandwidth fee that we'll omit in place of the omitted Internet circuit from an ISP. CloudFront allows the first 10 TB free and charges $0.85 per 10 TB after, so you'd be looking at around $2 to cover the 31.35 TB transferred as the 313k site is transferred 100 million times.","","p")
