## You Know What I Did Summer of 2024?




A series of 87 paragraphs and viginettes about camping through the summer of 2024.




# Dedication

To my sister, Jenn, who encouraged me to write about my travels.




# Foreword

Washington is an amazing State to be in. (Yes, it's that kind of book.) This is a factual log of my spring and summer of 2024. I felt as though I was chosen to experience these sets of events, so that I could write about them, as a gift to everyone whose job or body won't support so much adventure. My hope is to inspire every reader to embark on their own personal journey of exploration. And to be outdoors more - identify as a human of Earth and touch grass with feet while touching sky with eyes. If you're a hardcore home-body, try being a gentle campground-body for a night. Maybe at a campground with hookups and good signal, so you can still get your dopamine from the Internet, and/or keep in touch with family and friends. 

Names are changed to preclude litigation. Competing brands are sometimes conflated into a single business entity. No laws were broken during the events recored in this text, and its author does not condone violating laws or morals - some events might have been embellished for greater dramatic appeal. Individuals in this book have ancestries from around the Earth - different parts of Asia and India, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, among other places. Racial details excluded to prevent perpetuating stereotypes. If you only see one group of people represented herein, then you should look into how you yourself percieve and understand people.

# Prelude - Sprague

Sprague wasn't really near anything. Maps - you know, the map app - showed it as being basically along I-90. But it was about a mile southeast along WA-23 from the Interstate highway, and a couple hundred feet downhill. And then either a right or a left, since the State highway passed through the city as an elevated road, and city streets & the railroad had underpasses. Sometimes 25-30 trains per day passed through the town - I would lose count most days. No medical services, not even a private practice. The town "grocery store" was a huge mom-and-pop convenience store that didn't sell raw meat nor fried foods, and was half beer cooler. They knew their customers: anglers, hunters, road construction crews, and people who chose to live in Sprague. Since the motel was about 2 blocks east of the town's railroad crossings, each westbound train blew its horn-whistle just as it passed the motel. Most of these were 100+ car trains pulling a mixture of grain, lumber, steer, tanker, and box cars - and mixture of laden and empties. Modern Multiple-Unit train control systems allowed 21st Century trains to also have pusher locomotives at the end, reducing the train's length by up to a quarter mile. The graffiti on the cars reminded me of living in Seattle, and sometimes I would sit and watch a train go by, admiring the artwork. Twice a day passed the cute-by-comparison 4-car AmerailWays train. Fun fact: if you had a personal rail car, they could tow you around the country for about $5/mile. 

Late May was finally getting warm, so I used the picnic table in the motel's yard to cook my meals. Today was a US Federal holiday, so I had the day off. Despite my mother cooking from scratch throughout my childhood, I'd only embraced cooking as a primary way of feeding myself in the past year. Pan-frying steaks while boiling rice and veggies until the water boiled away was becoming a habit, on a green propane stove and $10 mess kit. My job as a part-time remote tech worker allowed me to stay in different places around the State for fun. Most of Tacoma has told my father that he looks like Burl Ives, and a guy at a bar once told me that I resembled a certain pro football quarterback who played on the other coast. A public software repository acted as my workplace, with my volunteer coworkers scattered around the planet: Madison, Toronto, London, Johannesburg, Cairo, Islamabad, Novobirisk, Bangalore, Datong (over a VPN), Melbourne, Hyougo, Honolulu, and beyond. A chatroom was our office. I drove a red 2019 "Cammy" hybrid sedan, the SoDo Boso, that I got new. Don't laugh, it's paid off. I felt like 2019 was the pinnacle for automotive engineering. I wanted to experience buying a new car at least once in my life, and I kept it because it fit my spectrum personality like a glove. It was named by someone at the dealer, as he placed the South of Downtown dealership's license plate cover over the plate starting with BOS0#. I kept the silly name as a good luck charm - the Fates (or whomever) had already left a mark. The trunk operated like the back of a teardrop trailer, and the back seat held larger objects like an RV undercarriage storage. My Battle Violets rode shotgun - 3 potted African-American violets which grew from a single office plant, bought on a lunch break for $5 over a decade ago. 

"It looks like you know what you're doing," said Hawaii Guy. Dressed in jeans and a green polo, with his blonde hair uncovered. He was a long-term stay. Living on the road for a while, the different kinds of travelers start to become apparent - overnight stay-and-go, weekend getaways, migrant & traveling workers, long-term vacationers, and monthly-rate users. This guy was a monthly-rate user and more - on great terms with the front desk and so bored that he was into the business of every other guest. He was born in the Midwest and moved to Hawaii 20 years ago, he had told me earlier. No driver's license, as he put it, because the Big Island had so many private backroads that licenses really weren't needed. But over here, no rental agency would lend him a car without a license. He was trying to get to Lewiston, which was about 40 miles as the crow flies, or about 90 minutes by car. By bus, it was about 3 hours from Spokane to Lewiston, or about 5 hours from Ritzville to Lewiston. And about 30 minutes from Sprague to either Spokane or Ritzville - by car only, no bus stops in the town. AmerailWays only passed through, not stopping in Sprague. Hawaii Guy was frustrated almost to the point of ranting in the parking lot. He didn't know it, but he had become a "typical liberal" in wanting the mutually exclusive goals of making mass transportation both efficient and available - if you had a bus on every corner every 10 minutes, that would be highly available and highly inefficient, leading to many empty buses. And if you only had buses stop where there were 5+ passengers to pick up, that would be highly efficient and unavailable. Here in Sprague, Hawaii Guy could be the only customer this month, and maybe the only one this year. He knew someone with land out there, Hawaii Guy had told me over coffee from the motel office's pod coffee maker. I was afraid that my car's right front wheel had a bearing going out, so I wasn't planning to drove that far and back in one stretch, and thankfully he didn't asked. He was an adult with money, and was looking to pay a fare, not a scrub begging for a ride. I mentioned ridesharing but he wasn't familiar with it - I didn't press as I was pretty sure there weren't any drivers freewheeling about this nigh-boondock and connecting backroads. 

# Willys Wildguy!

Knocking. 

Knocking. Yelling. Snoring.

Knocking. BREEEEE! A train went past. I was up before dawn, as usual. Yelling. As my water kettle was working to boil, I realized someone was knocking on the office door. Knocking and yelling for quite a while. Cawed a black bird "Nevermore." Click - water had boiled. Pouring. Half-and-half from the mini fridge. Yelling. Dressed and outside for ice from my cooler. He saw me - in his dark blue coat, shirt, blue jeans, and black shoes - and slowly approached. 

"Do you work here?" He asked, hopefully.

"No, sorry. I'm just staying here," I apologized, coffee in hand. The sky outside was just starting to lighten, from black to dark blue, among the thin clouds. I popped my trunk and put an ice cube into my coffee. Then, coffee in hand became coffee in belly. 

"Oh. My car broke down on the Interstate a couple of hours ago. I walked down the State highway to get here. I've been trying to call on the phone to get a room, but nobody answered. I was hoping you were the front desk," he explained. 

I considered trying to yell out into the twilight sky overhead for the front desk employee - a woman shorter than me and with wider hips - among the RVs and houses behind the motel and RV park. But I didn't know where she lived in this town of 500 people, so the thought stopped short. Hawaii Guy heard the discussion, and came out to join in, but the weary traveler wasn't too interested. 

"I'll go sleep in my car, I guess," replied the traveler, and walked away. I retreated back into my room, and Hawaii Guy returned to his. 

In the afternoon, while I was researching on and Hawaii Guy was angsting over - how to get him to Lewiston, Willys Wildguy showed up. Along with...Willys Wildwife? In non-matching tank tops and jean shorts. His wild beard and robust frame contrasted with her pretty face and slender body. I never got their relationship status. The black mid-2000s Willys had a banner with "@WillysWildguy on Pinstagram" on the side and Pennsylvania plates on the back. Along with a huge custom aluminum overhead rack, holding a couple empty 5 gallon water bottles, a solar panel, a couple coolers - and something that looked like an upside down boat motor with no screw, which Hawaii Guy called out as a wind generator. Then I realized the weird holographic star on the side of the Willys was actually the propeller for the wind generator. Hawaii Guy broke the ice and started asking questions about their wild ride. 

"Yeah, we've been camping around the country, doing the whole remote tech worker thing," said our wild friend. "We dropped the kids off in Alaska, then had been camping for free on BLM and DNR lands. The aluminum rack came from an old IT job, when they upgraded the server room, and I customized it onto this bad boy. Got the wind generator for windy places, and also a solar panel. Have a battery and inverter, but everything is USB-C so I hardly use it. I try to get work from time to time, you know, keep some money coming in." He seemed to have it all figured out. 

Our wild Willys friends were headed to Grayland. I told them that I'd been there in 2021 and it was enjoyable. We had an incredible heat wave that year, with parts of the Seattle region reaching 140 F. Many Cascades peaks lost their glaciers. Grayland was possibly the only place in the State below 100 F - it was 85 F on the beach, where the 40 mile per hour (MPH) onshore winds could abate the region's extreme heatwave. Being the Goldilocks Zone meant that even the Sun wasn't powerful enough to boil the oceans. I had sat on my "rope throne" - a broken director's chair whose seat which I had repaired with 75 feet of rope in 2020 - under my golf umbrella and behind my car's left rear door. Just barely out of the sun and also out the sandy wind. Back to the present, I told the wild couple that I was going there again this summer, to which he replied that they'd be there in the next few days. He asked for advice on the return route - I-90 near Seattle or dip south near Eugene. I suggested WA-14, but this was their westbound route. So he settled on Eugene, since the Seattle region was always the same. Him and his traveling companion departed the next morning. 	

# Bees, trees, and retirees.

I departed the morning after. The path from Sprague to Fishhook went southwest all of the way down through Pasco, before backtracking east. Not Fishkill - that was the other way. Fishhook would be my first time camping in a decade, and other than that singular trip in 2014, it was my first time in about 20 years. When I was a child, my father thought preparation was the worthier part - he would fill up a station wagon and 4 foot by 8 foot moving trailer with literally every bit of camping kit that we owned and every tool he could fit, and all of the food that my mom could squeeze into 2 large coolers. As he had put it: "just in case the brakes go out and we needed to do a brake job at the campsite." He got praised for being over-prepared one time in the Army during the early 1960s, and had been trying to get more praise for it since. My only solo camping experience had been fitting a normal queen mattress into a single 3-person dome tent, in someone's back yard, and that ought to be enough for anyone. 

About a month ago, I stayed in Sequim. (Pronounced "skwim".) It was a Native word that meant "hole in the sky," someone told me when I was young, but I couldn't find a Modern reference for this. Instead, I found that it's called the "blue hole" today. It describes the unexpected rain shadow north of the Hoh Rainforest and Olympic National Park, which sometimes formed into a circular break in the clouds. Before Europeans, the place was a sandy desert, a local woman had told me. I happened to be staying there during the annual Irrigation Festival, to celebrate when settlers had set up an overflow diversion on the Dungeness River in 1895, diverting floodwaters onto the sandy plains and otherwise allowing the river to flow normally. During my visit, the area had been covered in bees, trees, and retirees from the nearby Seattle region. Affluent housing sprawled up the tree-covered rainforest foothills to the south of the city.

While staying in Sequim, I picked up a red 71-can cooler from the Walton's World. Inside of it went a smaller black plastic 24-can cooler box that I bought back in 2022. This gave me a century-old icebox refrigerator in my trunk. 7 pounds of ice lasted about 24 hours with a daily high of 85 F, and the inner box had a capacity of about 19 pounds of crushed, for a max of 3 days of operation per ice reload. Usually a max of 2 days on crushed ice - block was rare to find, so I had less experience with it. And block ice didn't go into the coffee nearly as easily. This gave me both creamer and ice for my coffee anywhere, and coupled with a propane stove gave the hot water too. The stove I had bought in Sequim along with the cooler, and had my "$100 cup of coffee" at Sequim Bay State Park - $60 for the stove, $25 for the cooler, $8 for the water kettle, $5 for the propane canister, and $2 for the half-and-half. Since then, my cost per cup had amortized somewhat, and I was planning to amortize more here.

Packed tightly around and behind the cooler were 4 stacks of 3-gallon totes. By keeping and reusing a couple dozen identical totes, I had one whenever I needed one. And they stacked really well. It was my "infinite tote system", and wasn't unlike an unlimited storage hole from tabletop games. My lifestyle was a celebration of the ephemerality of modern life - this meant that everything I owned was an inexpensive retail off the shelf product. So if anything broke or wore out, I could just pull another from the tote system, by "reaching through it" and visiting any major retailer for a quick retail experience. And in this State, you were never more than an hour's drive from the nearest major retailer. This reminded me of another anime character, having a magical storehouse from which he can pull almost anything. My storehouses were mostly named Walton's World and WinHeart, and the magic that I expend was called money. I was eventually able to go 90 days without cleaning it out, without any foul smells coming from the cooler. 

After having to clean out the whole ice box system a few times, I develoed "a few" simple rules to kept everything clean: 

- Center ice box: only ice, and sealed water/soda/beer cans & bottles go in the center ice chest. This keeps the ice (and the water it was floating in) clean enough to drink. 
  -  Use care with glass in this section. Cans may get dented. Especially if things *almost* fit, and you push down on the lid just a little bit, and a sharp ice cube gets pushed against the can or bottle, something might puncture or rupture.
  -  Cold water is still a refrigerant. Don't dump out this section until all of the ice is melted, AND after purchasing more ice. So only ever in parking lots, with new ice leaning against a tire. The quickest way to dump it out is to unpile the trunk, pull out the cooler, put it on the ground, open it and pull out the inner icebox, then tip this against the side of the cooler, so the water filters out but any cans or bottles are kept inside.  
  -  Pull any cans and bottles out of the inner icebox before adding new ice, then stack them on top of the new ice. This keeps the coldest stuff at the bottom, and keeps the cans and bottles accessible. It's difficult to dig them out of a few pounds of loose crushed ice, and very difficult to dig them out of a block of refrozen crushed ice.
  -  This water is clearwater and can be consumed, but might have a weird flavor, from when it was frozen. I've only drank it in desperation, in 95 F or hotter weather.
- Everything in the other 2 sections must be in a sealed container, airtight if possible. The left and right refrigerated areas easily pool with an inch or 2 of graywater, especially when the ice in the center chest melts and leaks through a crack in the inner ice box. Or spilling when going around tight turns at speed - most refrigerators don't slalom roundabouts. But also from condensation on the outside of the inner cooler. At this point, it wasn't that bad and I tipped the whole cooler upside down every 2-3 days and drain it out. 
- Meats must go into a container, and I had a pair of 4.7 cup rectangular glass "bowls" with airtight snap-top lids. Each held 4-5 pork chops or small steaks, for about 2-3 pounds of meat, and kept any drippings from entering the water pooled at the bottom of the cooler. These go on the right side, and give enough space for 4 soda cans or 2 round containers in front of them, and the same on top. Beer bottles take up twice as much space as cans, and in front of these glass bowls has been a pretty good place to store them. Consider putting a piece of cardboard between them and the bowls. 
- Vegetables should go into round plastic containers - I used to use a national brand of round container but recently switched to WinHeart, whose lower and broader profile stacked much better inside a tote. Some vegetables might last longer with the humidity, but end up falling in the water at the bottom, when going around a tight turn, or maybe just pulling something else out of the pile. Spinach is especially troublesome. Some, like whole heads of iceberg lettuce, are simply too big to fit in this fridge arrangement.
- Dairy products - milk and creamer were fine in the cooler and should sit up against the icebox in the left section. Paper containers usually last 5-7 days, so a quart of half-and-half might work better than a half gallon paper box, depending on how much goes into each cup of coffee. And if it goes into other foods such as oatmeal or mashed potatoes. Bacteria in the inch or so of standing water in the bottom of the outer section would eventually work through waxy paper containers and spoil the dairy product inside. 
- Butter should go into the same round container as vegetables - round off 2 sticks and you can sorta squeeze both into one round. One of these can hang out at the bottom of the cooler for a few weeks, while the other butter got used.
- Cheese - individually wrapped packages like cheese sticks work best. Otherwise, the package should be resealable, and keep it sealed. These might also fall off when cornering. 
- Yellow plastic egg holder works great for holding eggs, on the left side of the left section. There should be just enough space for this to sit on its side vertically, next to half-gallon milk and creamer containers. Oriented so there were 4 rows by 3 colums of eggs. Use up the eggs in the bottom row first, so the older eggs were kept out of the water at the bottom. In the USA, eggs apparently got washed before shipping, which was why they needed to be refrigerated. And that in most of Europe, eggs were sold at room temperature. Either way, I believe storing eggs in very cold water for several days wasn't recommended. 

Into Pasco and back out, never leaving the highway. I'd only be at Fishhook for one night. I was being brave and willing to take a huge risk that someone might rip through the tent wall and stab me in the middle of the night. Or so "the voice of the Internet in my head" told me, sometimes screaming in my head that I was crazy for taking such a risk. I should be inside a wooden motel room and behind a locked door! And so one night was as much of that brain-scolding as I was able to endure, at least for now. The next night, I'd be "safely" inside a MotelCo again, I told the terror in my head. 

Rolled up to the gatehouse about 1:50 PM, and someone else was waiting. Parked and walked up. The guy waiting said they were really strict and told him to come back right at 2 PM. Waiting in the shade, we found the park rules, solamente en Español, and I got out my phone to translate. That's cool - camping should be for everyone, not just us Anglophones. Pretty normal rules - move your tent every 2 days, put trash in the dumpsters, use life jackets in and around the water, no metal detectors or quadcopters/hexcopters/etc. Eventually the 10 minutes passed and the gatehouse opened. 

"Do you have firewood?" I asked the gatehouse attendant, after she had checked me in. A thinner woman with gray hair, she was wearing the khaki ranger uniform with long pants. 

"Yes," she replied, "the shop down the road sells firewood, and we have a big pile of deadwood you can dig through." I thanked her and headed to my site. This campground loop was a modest slope up a steep hill, and flat parking pads and picnic table areas were carved out of the hill. A small, grassy hill separated every site. A few trees overhead provided reasonable shade. 

To display the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE)'s literal power over the universe, in the form of electrical power, every campsite in the loop had an electrical hookup tower. Wait. I'd never been camping with hookups, but there was a 120 Volt 20 Amp plug about a foot from my car. Well, all of my power adapters just happen to be in this "power tote," plugged into a power strip whose cord extends through a round crack in the lid. So I plugged it in. Found that a laptop sits very nicely on my rear window, with the trunk lid open. It would slide down the window and rest against the trunk's rubber weatherstripping and inner gutter. Arraying the 3 laptops across the back window gave me a kind of console above my fridge - work, game, video.

Back towards the gatehouse on foot, to find the deadwood pile and dig through it. Deadwood was always dry, so made great firewood: burning well without the cracking, popping, and steam from the water in greenwood. Lots of 4 to 6 foot long branches and roots. If only I had an axe or saw, I could have cut some great pieces of firewood. But I was under-prepared, what a tragedy. 

I hadn't yet unboxed the tent. I got it a year ago when I nearly ran out of money and made similar plans. But instead of taking life by the horns back then, assembling a solar charging kit and inverter, and spending a few days in Ilwaco - I aborted and spent a couple of months with my elderly father. "It's an adventure," I had told myself, and learned a lot more about my father and my family than I had wanted to learn. Out of the box and bag came an orange dome tent. Like a certain anime character, I really liked that vibrant shade of orange. Other than the color, the tent was just like the red tent I had a decade ago. Err...other than the color, and dog hair. This new orange tent didn't have the yellow dog hair from Poncho, the 120 lb yellow lab who passed in 2016. Nor the white hair from Mojita, the frisky half-husky who passed in 2018. Nor hairs from other dogs I knew in the 2010s. Starting fresh was sometimes the best way. 

I crumpled some paper into a cardboad box, inside the fire pit, then piled the deadwood scraps on top. Performing a touch attack on the paper with the lighter a couple of times started a small blaze. I didn't have enough lumber so it never became more than a small blaze. One of the best fire starters were paper towels soaked in bacon grease from breakfast, but I didn't have those material components either.

"Pleasant Campers" said a little sign in front of the campsite next to mine. I wanted a little sign too. Grabbing the cardboard that my tent came in, I cut it in half and wrote "We <3 Shade" on it, and drew circles as stick figures for the Battle Violets. Arrow, Biffy, and Cece - the trio were pushing pink flowers above their dark green leaves, which concealed the dirt in their 6 inch blue pots. I don't think anyone ever figured out that the circles were supposed to be the plants in the car. I put "Homeless and loving it" on the sign. For one, I hadn't come to emotional terms with being inaffluent and not owning real estate. But it was true that the only dirt I had bought was for the Battle Violets, and the only lease I had entered into was for my mailbox in Kennewick. A bumper sticker I used to have said: "I started out with nothing, and I still have most of it left." Also, I like to fight the homeless stereotype and show that homeless doesn't mean hopeless. Contrary to what the bleeding hearts had usually put into their charity ads, most homeless had jobs and most unemployed are housed - the Venn diagram overlap is rare. I moved out of apartments and started "hotelling" in December 2020, and while I felt more at home in a hotel room than in my own apartment, I thought I might feel even more at home in a campsite. "I'm like a bird" I put on the sign. Most people would think that I felt free...until they heard my constant whistling. I could whistle while inhaling as well as exhaling, allowing me to whistle for dozens of minutes on end. My father talked to himself - he cultivated this, as a way of getting more attention from the people around him. He also still used paper checks, taking forever to fill one out, just so people would have to wait for him. To combat this rising scourge in myself, I had taught myself to whistle. Popular music like Casino Face, Earth's Theme, as well as my own melodies, were available for public request. I could put together an album - order now and get original songs including Morning Bird, Suddenly There's My Plant, and countless interludes!

As I was about to turn raw ingredients into dinner, a sudden gust of wind pushed my tent over and tumbling down the loop, into the next campsite. "Runaway tent!" I yelled, scrambling to retrieve it. Running into my neighbor's campsite, I put a stop to its tumbleweed imitation before a collision with their class B RV. After staking it down, I fried my pork chops, and boiled rice with broccoli and carrots. Luxuriated in the conveniences of modern pseudo-glamping. Inside the orange tent, I had a twin-sized air mattress, with a fitted sheet. On this were another sheet and a quilt. This kept me warm last summer when sleeping indoors, and I was hoping it would work outdoors as well. It felt like home, just a little bit, and I could sleep here. My winter coat doubled as a pillow, since the hood was perfect for partially covering my head. Just like in motels, I planned to sleep with "2 of my 3 eyes" covered, so my brain got warm but I could still see the door without moving. I had made my bed inside the tent, now just to lay in it, and snuggle with my anxieties. I could hear the couple across the loop road from me - the guy almost constantly talking, trying to be romantic, and the woman occasionally agreeing. 

This campground was just over the hill from the train, and we heard a few loud horn-whistles in the evening, heralded by the infrasonic vibrations of steel car on steel rail. Night came and went without any knife-wielding maniacs, then morning all too quickly. Striking the orange tent, I headed back to Richland. 

# Richland Interlude 1 - "Lost" Is An Interesting Sensation 

Being lost meant having 2 locations - your current location & another location - and wanting the other one. This pattern seemed very similar to fear, which was the state of having 2 mental models, and wanting the other one. Being homeless meant I didn't feel lost anymore. When I was in my apartment, I had the worst wanderlust, and would go on extended day trips. Through those day trips, I would worry about the stuff in my apartment. Theft or fire or rat or meteor, oh my! No matter where I went, I wanted to be somewhere else. But since moving out of apartmenting as a lifestyle, I was at home in the car I lived from, and the place where I sat was also the only place where I wanted to be. Even if I were taking a new route, and did not fully know how to arrive at my destination, I still felt at home and no longer lost. When I left an area, I fully abdicated any interest that I had there, and moved on. 

Checked into the MotelCo on the Richland side of the border with Kennewick. They had a 4-day deal, with just the bare room without the microwave & fridge upgrade, and this worked for me. I got to stay in a motel during the week for work, and experimented with outdoor life on the weekends. And it wasn't like I didn't have a fridge - there was one in my trunk, so I kept making my coffee like usual. Going to a grocery store every other morning for ice started to become routine. It was how this refrigerator was powered: the store would "charge up" water with a "lack of heat", then I would dscharge this lack of heat inside the cooler system. What I was buying wasn't just the water molecules, but also the lack of energy held between them. Like an inverted temperature battery. 

Stepping out of my motel room, I was greeted by a taller woman who was staying a couple of rooms down from me. She asked if I were a long-term guest there. I had seen her walk up to her room just after check-in, back down to her car, and ascend the stairs again. I thought she might have been underwhelmed by the accomodation and concerned for her personal safety - apparently she found merely being inside a wooden motel room and behind a locked door to be insufficient. I'd seen a few long-term guests: Someone on the bottom floor had excitedly returned from the front desk at about checkout time. Another guest, and her 2 kids, got to check out of an upstairs single-bed room and into a downstairs double-bed room. And third guest, top floor corner unit, had a cat that liked to sit in the motel room's window. I gave her a bit of my background, then told her that I could pick out the few long-term residents, and gestured vaguely at the room with the cat. She thanked me and departed in her car for the afternoon. I watched her drive away, then stood outside, transfixed by the blue sky. It was why I had moved here, from the Seattle region, during the previous winter. 

"(One) may live without love — what is passion but pining? / But where is the (person) that can live without dining?" - Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton, quoted in "Camping and Camp Cooking" by Frank A Bates. (Generalized by this book's author. Dining should be for everyone, not just those of us who were pining.)

In preparation to spend significant amounts of time outside, I had been reading Camping and Camp Cooking. It was written over a century ago, in 1909, just a few years before the State Parks department came into existence. A substance that had puzzled me was hardtack. The book mentioned this foodstuff numerous times, and even gave a recipe for making it: mix flour and water, flatten, and bake for about 20 minutes on each side in a Dutch oven. The camping book mentioned that there were numerous ways of drying the dough, and that hydrating it again was usually necessary for consumption without the breaking of teeth. Something kept rattling around in the back of my mind - this was basically unleavened bread. A quick Internet search brought confirmation - it really was matzo, the "unleavened bread" mentioned in The Bible, for people to eat as though their kitchen were packed and they were departing on a long journey. The Biblical recipe varied only really in drying technique, with a 2 minute ungreased hot pan fry instead of the 20 minutes in the oven. It occurred to me that the war on poverty was really a war on hardtack, and "winning" this war had separated us from a historical connection with people from 2000 years ago and beyond. This also fed into the edible chemistry system I'd been working on. One kind of food was substrate-binder-solvent, not unlike glue or paint in operation, but with edible ingredients like starch, gluten, and water. Hardtack used starch as the substrate, gluten for a binder, and water as the solvent. Not unlike pasta, meaning that the innovation brought back to Europe by Marco Polo was extruded hardtack. Add a little bit of a lard, as an edible plasticizer, and hardtack turned into crackers. And a lot of lard, and it turned into tortillas. 

It was 85 F and sunny outside, with Rayleigh scattering generating heavenly horizon-to-horizon blue skies. I walked downstairs to my car. Living out of it, I was usually getting something from it every couple of hours. An older man had been sitting on the lower steps, talking on the phone, but this time he was just holding the phone. Staring at the turned-off screen. 

"I'm from Florida," he introduced himself as i walked past, "and this was as cold as I can stand it." 

"I'm from Tacoma," I replied, "and this is as hot as I can stand it." I told him that I was headed for the coast, and he nodded his head with understanding. I went on that this was the warmest part of the State, and also the dryest part, because it was a box. "The Cascades make one rain shadow," I said, holding my right forearm vertically. "And the Horse Hills make another," I said, putting my left arm's knuckle against my right arm's elbow, trying to make a right angle. "The humidity that makes it into this box usually stacks up at the far end, near the Rockies foothills," I concluded. He nodded and wished me well on my travels. 

As additional preparation, I enabled Hibernate on each laptop. I wasn't sure why this feature had become so buried, as it was very useful for saving power, and also keeping a laptop cool to extend battery life. The last item was on my mind from having to replace my GT laptop battery over the winter. It had inflated and expanded the laptop's case, to 3 times the laptop's normal size. So I found and enabled the power settings on each laptop, before creating shortcuts consisting of "shutdown /h" to make this simpler. Double-clicking the shortcut would power down the laptop almost immediately - saving the RAM contents to SD or SSD, depending on laptop - and locking the laptop OS in the process. 

# Double Or Nothing

I went double-or-nothing at much closer Hood Park, risking knife-wielding maniacs for a whole 2 nights. Being between Pasco and Burbank, Hood Park was one of two campgrounds within the Tri-Cities metropolitan area. It was the 2nd largest population center in the State, but didn't exist on paper - consisting of 4 cities and 7 towns spread across 3 counties, around the confluence of 4 rivers: Columbia, Snake, Yakima, and everyone omitted the relatively-minor Walla Walla. The area had become my home over the previous winter, and so I stocked up at my local WinHeart Foods. Including 20 liters of water in 40 bottles - it was a lot of plastic waste, but my body felt better drinking it than the local tap. A lot of taps had mold in them, including the one that I drank from all last winter and spring, I suspected. These bottles came in a convenient volume, as 5 liters (about a day's water) fit nicely into a tote from the tote system. Fun fact: One gallon (3,785 ml) plus one cup (240 ml) was just 5 teaspoons (25 ml) more than 4 liters (4,000 ml). 

This campground was set up in much the same way as Fishhook, since both were run by the Walla Walla divsion of the ACOE. The surface street route from the MotelCo, through Kennewick, to the WinHeart grocery store - took more time than the mostly-highway route from WinHeart to Hood Park. I arrived early again, so I was waiting for the gatehouse to open at 2 PM, and was making conversation with a couple of other guests to kill time. One had walked over from a truck towing an RV, both with Oregon license plates. Her grey t-shirt said "Life is better as a Canadian", and her male partner - an Oregon native, she said later - was driving the pickup and RV trailer combination. 

"Are you from the north or the south?" I asked her, grinning. 

"I was born in Canada, but I live in Oregon now," she said, gesturing to her partner and combintion. The conversation moved onto the park rules, and eventually the gatehouse opened. I was second in line. After the park ranger read the park rules to the first in line, it was my turn. 

"You're here for just 1 night, correct?" asked the guy at the gatehouse, looking at the reservation on his computer. He was wearing the park's polo over khaki shorts and black boots, seated on an office chair inside the small air-conditioned building. 

"I made a mistake and only reserved 1 day, so I reserved the same site again for tomorrow. If it was okay with you, I'll just stay in the spot all weekend," I replied as conditioned air flowed out of the little window and past my face. I rolled into my site on Friday with food, water, fuel, and an extension cord. Odd - this site seemed to have 2 tables. Plugging in, I got mediocre signal with my hotspot. Just 2 bars, because it was inside my trunk. I grabbed it and started moving it around, and suddenly felt a searing pain in my right hand. I recoiled in pain and looked at my right hand - 3 parallel half-inch burns crossed my ring finger knuckle. The 5G hotspot instructions said to stay 28 cm (about 11.5 inches) away from it, and I guessed this was why. In some ways, this wireless technology was like a microwave oven - without the metal walls, and instead using multiple antenna beamforming to aim incredibly intense energy into the hotspot's radio circuits. So I resolved to not move it while it was plugged in, and kept it in its own tote box - with the hotspot at one end, the tote 16 inch long was long enough to move around by the handle at the other end without risking further injury. This allowed fine tuning of placement. Sometimes, shifting a few inches could vastly improve ping times - and as a gamer, cloud engineer, and everything between, I knew that ping was life.

This campground was a long, rounded slope down to the Snake river-lake. It had been a farm, bought by the Hood family in the 1920s, and tilled for a single generation before being bought by the ACOE. In order to flood the place, they had to buy the property first, and they made a campground out of the unflooded section. This lake of the river-lake was technically the unofficial Lake Wallula, and it was probably possible to travel to Tri-Cities or Plymouth by boat, without using a dam-lock. From time to time, a speedboat buzzed past - possibly on a patrol of the dams. While seeming insignificant, there was always a chance that a dam would fail and they'd need to perform an emergency evacuation of the park. Which was why all vehicles had to back into pads and face in the direction of the loop's travel, said the gatehouse. 

As I was setting up, a park ranger visited the guest at the site across the loop's small paved street. His site had a large yurt-shaped tent and nothing else. A skinny guy, he was wearing a khaki polo shirt and pants over black shoes. No stove nor firewood, so not sure what he was eating. No car, so not sure how he arrived or would depart; Ben Franklin Transit was named for Benton and Franklin counties, and I didn't know if they provided service out here in western Walla Walla County. The duo stood there, chatting. By the time I had my hotspot in place, the ranger had asked the guest to move the tent, and the guest agreed to do so. Then they continued chatting. About the weather, about other campers, about the sprinklers, about other stuff nearby, about things I didn't hear that well. I started setting up my tent and fine-tuning my hotspot location, and eventually the couple ran out of things to discuss, so the ranger continued his rounds around the loop. The guest started moving several boxes out of the yurt, and would eventually move it about 30 feet towards the river-lake, before moving everything back inside. The only food I saw was a Walton's membership warehouse sized box of granola bars. It must have held more than 100. 

I drove out to the pair of gas stations across US-12 for ice and firewood. The overpass was one of the new dual roundabout styles, and I was stuck behind a lumbering semi truck through the route. The gas stations were across a small access road from each other, and were the only buildings for a mile in any direction, being surrounded by farmland and highway. 1 bundle for $5 or 2 for $7, so I got an extra. A group of young girls were holding a car wash in the other gas station, so I headed over after buying the ice and wood. "These were the Wallula dance troop," said the troop's 40-something leader, "and this was how we're paying to get to the championships." She was wearing a denim vest over shorts, and her feet were in flip-flops. I gave her $20 as the very young teenagers washed the majority of my car, next to a lifted pickup that they were also washing. One of the young ladies had ascended the tall vehicle, which was nearly 3 times her height, and was crawling across the hood to wash the windshield.

Yellowjackets, I would later learn, were pretty thick in the table closer to the shade. So I sled-pulled the other table into the shade and moved everything within a dozen feet of the hookup. One yellowjacket was also interested in the hookup. I could see her visually measuring the space inside for a possible hive - good entryway, down-facing to keep in heat. A little wide but could be walled with paper. Good space inside - a nice brood could fit along one side, and a wall of honey on the other. Sealed against the elements, and not far from human-food. We danced about, with her going around and around the hookup, and occasionally bringing a few of her brood sisters over to check it out. Most of them seemed interested, much to my dismay, and she was encouraged by the attention. After a few hours of this, while setting up the tent and otherwise relaxing, I put a tote lid into the hookup and jammed it open. I didn't want to damage my cord by using it as the prop, but the tote lids were cheap and sturdy. The yellowjacket was annoyed by this, but she wasn't strong enough to remove the tote lid on her own, and wasn't sure what to do. She flew back and forth between the hookup and the table, trying to get her brood-sisters to help remove the lid. 

Some time later, another park ranger came around the loop in an electric utility truck - basically a golf cart with a small truck bed on the back and knobby tires. He was swapping the piece of paper clipped onto the post at the end of my parking pad, when I called him over. He was wearing a tight-fitting park polo above khaki shorts and black boots with gray socks. His full beard and hair were white, contrasting with my dirty blonde hair and beard. "This table has a lot of yellowjackets," I stated, pointing at the table, and mentioned that they reminded me of Sequim in April. Like a pro, the white-bearded ranger flipped the aluminum table over, pulled out his can of bee spray from his utility truck, and let loose on the the table's underside. "There were 6 nests in there," he told me. He had been in the Coast Guard, stationed near Sequim for a decade, and we chatted for a bit about the bees on the northern slopes of the Olympic Peninusla. I thanked him and he continued on his rounds.

That night, I got cold. The weather station at nearby Pasco International Airport said it was in the low 60s, according to a weather app. But the meat thermometer that I kept in my trunk said it was in the mid-50s. This was one footnote about climate change, where many official sensors were located inside cities or urban areas, where we also put lots of stone and concrete to absorb and store heat. This might be why trees hadn't been feeling the heat, and had been growing like it was colder than in the 1800s, shown by tree rings. My sleeping kit, inside the tent, was a twin air mattress with fitted twin sheet over it. Then another sheet, and a thick cold-weather quilt on top. Clearly this wasn't enough, but I had another solution: Burn More Calories (BMC). This was a process where I burn extra calories for heat. But my body kept erroring, telling me that "in order to BMC, we must EMC," and Eat More Calories (EMC) was complicated by at least this new sodium issue. "Wear more clothes" was the fallback strategy, so I put on a shirt at some point.

# Quadcopters And Metal Detectors

The bathroom building was in the center of the highly-eccentric elliptical campground loop, basically a flattened circle to fit into the long and short campground property. And my site was on the far end - about a football field away, then around the playground equipment and the bed of bark surrounding it, and another half-football field to the building itself. For my second day here, I wasn't quite sure what to do. I had planned to spend my Saturday morning figuring out what to do with my spare time. I would up spending most of my time coming to terms with the invalidation of my knife-wielding maniac fear. Nobody had attacked, nobody had threatened, indeed nobody had come near my campsite. As I was departing, a family broke out their metal detectors and quadcopter. Their allele distributions suggested their ancestries were from locations that spoke languages other than Spanish, and they apparently hadn't pulled out their phones to read las reglas del parque.

# Richland Interlude 2 - Apply creamer to crema

The 1909 camping book discussed several ways to make coffee. For percolators, it described pouring the water through the percolator basket, and filling the coffee pot high enough with water to reach the percolator basket. Then keep on the heat, just under a boil. Basically the basket was like an inside-out French press in separating grounds from liquid coffee. Hot water would swirl with grounds, making the coffee stronger over time. But the percolator I saw in the Walton's World had too long of a tube for this to work. Instead, it seemed to work as described in a certain technology connection video: the boiled water cavitated up the inner tube, up into the bubble in the lid, and then out into the percolation basket. Quickly this became weak coffee, and boiling coffee burned it, making weak burned coffee going back into the percolator basket. This wasn't the same process as described by the book, and the device stocked on this aisle didn't seem capable of performing the process described by the book.

The book also described simply boiling water and pouring into coffee, then allowing to brew for a bit. Just like making tea. And using a filter to differentiate grounds from liquid coffee. Gauze was mentioned as a viable filter in the other book, and it recommended keeping the heat on the coffee while it brews. This was basically a French press again, but the French press had a metal filter instead of gauze. I was having a cup of MotelCo drip brew every morning that I stayed there. Having been drinking coffee since college, decades ago, I had made a full loop in preparation styles. My mother loved coffee too, and bought an espresso machine that she couldn't operate when I was a kid. So I became her 11 year old barista for a couple of years. I didn't like coffee back then, so didn't really know what I was doing back then, and probably didn't make very good brews. From counter-bought espresso in college, to the Big Gray Machine at the tech company office, to pod coffee while working from home - a series of tubes sits inside every pod machine, which was almost as much fun to descale as tube monitors were to degauss. Then through French press, and back to making instant. Blending Walton's World and WinHeart medium roasts. The Walton's World was too dark, and the WinHeart too light, so like Goldilocks I would ratio about 1.5 tablespoons of WinHeart to 0.5 tablespoons of Walton's World. One of the keys was having boiled filtered water. Boiling further purified the filtered water, and made sure it was hot enough to melt the coffee solids out of the cellulose bean substrate. Regardless of coffee form, a temperature of at least 190 F seemed to maximize extraction, which was about when the cavitation in the bottom of the kettle stopped making audible noise. Maximize in the calculus sense. Another key was to "flood" the coffee - that was, have the water physically shift the location of the grounds or crystals. Then came applying creams, milks, and sweeteners to the drinker's choosing - these had to be added while the coffee was still very hot, so they also melted into the mixture more evenly. Last, dunking an ice cube stirred the concoction. Walking past the dairy section, I found the half-and-half.

Some cultures believed that the ability to drink extremely hot beverages to be a sign of youth and vitality, and encouraged everyone to drink extremely hot beverages. This was no different than other cultures believing that the ability to drink extremely alcoholic beverages to be a sign of youth and vitality, encouraging everyone to drink extremely alcoholic beverages. In reality, both often caused bulk cell death, increasing the chance of cancer - a disease caused by errors and mistakes in cell replacement. An Internet video said that 6 different DNA copying systems would have to fail for cancer to occur, and each of these had a 1/1000 chance of failing. It felt like a DM rolling up goblins in a cancer dungeon, and getting a goblin on each natural 20 - give them just a few dice rolls and the DM probably won't get any goblins, but give the DM a few hundred dice rolls and they're sure to roll few cancer goblins to attack you. Maximizing longevity required making as few cancer goblin dice rolls as possible across your body's life. The ice cube would mix the layers and bring creams and sweeteners back up to the surface, while dropping the temperature from around 190 F down to around 130 F. Pop quiz, physics fans: how many BTUs become transferred from 240 ml of 88 C water to 15 ml of 0 C water? Bonus question: how many infrared photons would this transfer involve?

I've never put sugar in my coffee. My relationship with sugar began with most of my family members being diabetic for most of my life. Around meal times, there would be a race to the bathroom, to either pill up with glucose inhibitors or shoot up with insulin. More than one of my relatives acted like a glucose addict, getting a heady rush from half of a candy bar. I didn't see the appeal - it was only sugar. Health was what diet and exercise were for - exploration of space: if I was going to take pills and use needles, then I wanted them to make me indescribably high, not just let me eat meals like a normal person.

"How do you grow beyond a mere growth mindset? What comes after?" I had posted on social media before going shopping. I would later find that my post didn't get any responses. "Persistence is stagnation" was one of my personal maxims. "Push. Push Harder." is another. If you would like read all of my personal maxims, please see my website. Don't be afraid of fear - thanks Roosevelt. Be afraid that you didn't try hard enough to succeed. Be afraid that you didn't get as much completed as possible. Be afraid that you didn't make enough new innovations or connections, and would regret hindsight clearly showing where you could have done more but got lazy instead. Dream a bigger dream - a much higher purpose. Roman Empire thought of the day: Julius Caesar occasionally got off his high horse, grabbed a shield, and SHOVED the other side - to make sure his troops won the battle. Work like this was why at least one of them called him "Imperator." There was a belief that persistence was victory in some way, but it wasn't. "Mere life isn't victory," said a fictional religious leader, "and mere death isn't failure." Instead, our lives were the time-spaces we had been given to find seeds of victory, clear a field, sow the seeds, tend to them, and then harvest the victory when it ripened. 	

Just filled up the car with ice, water, propane, and food. Packed the meat into the glass bowls, then used hand sanitizer. Put the styrofoam meat packages into a grocery store trash can and the cart into a corral. Back into the car, pressed the power button and the car beeped, ready to drive. A middle-aged male-female couple popped out from behind the van in the next parking spot, ambling past, and the guy was taking his time. Down went my car's windows to clear out the stuffy air while I waited. And waited. The guy was still taking his time. Once they were safely past, I pulled out into the lane, my car warbling gently. 

# Chat With A Government Employee

"Oh, I'm sorry," he said with a smirk. "I didn't hear your engine running so I didn't know your car was on." This wasn't the first time he'd done this to me.

Kennewick bordered the Columbia River, so it was at a relatively low elevation - around 300 to 400 feet above sea level. Well, parts were. On a map, the southbound Columbia bent east, before making a U-turn through the Horse Hill mountain range, between Finley and Wallula. Back on Earth, the ridge's peaks were about 2200 feet in elevation. Heading south on US-395, the highway increased from 50 MPH to 70 MPH not far past the burger bars, and it was a 10% incline for the next few miles. But once past the 3 sets of ridges, it was all downhill towards Plymouth and Umatilla. I was terrified that I was slowly grinding away the last of my bearing, so I drove merely 70 MPH, suffering every driver to pass me. Arriving in Plymouth, the car screen said it had achievd 50.4 MPG.

Check-in wasn't until 2 PM, so I had an hour to kill. I went to the day use area to clear my head. Just after arriving, a small truck with government labels parked in the parking lot a few spots away from mine, and a young woman in a uniform got out. She walked south across the parking lot, and into the trees near the riverbank. My suspicious and over-Internet'ed brain started making up stories that she was secretly spying on me and that I should drive away, but I told it to stop and go sit on the grass. I joined it on the steep grassy slope leading to the un-lifeguarded swimming area. After about 10 minutes, I wanted a soda from my fridge, so me and my brain climed up the hill to find that she was walking back over, arms full. She walked up to me and introduced herself, before telling me about the mulberry trees in the area. She was an Oregon DNR employee, and was gathering data on the fish caught by anglers. And that she came here on her work breaks to pick fruit. She handed me one of the blackberry-looking fruits that she had gathered in her arms. I hadn't seen these before and didn't know it from poison, but trusted her a little and accepted one. I absorbed what she told me with the grace and agility of an elderly bison, and she was driving away before it had registered in my brain to asked for her number. 

My original plan was to spend several hundred dollars at the local hardware outlet and assemble an off-grid kit in the back of my car. But I couldn't afford to do that and still have a "safety net" to stay in a motel if it didn't work. I was going to spend a single night here before going to Maryhill State Park, to launch off and shorten the trip there. But I chickened out at the last minute and made reservations at the same Richland MotelCo location for next week too.

The woman at the gatehouse told me "Your car is so quiet. Is it one of those electric cars? I haven't seen one before." So I told her a litte about my car - hybrid meant half gasoline car and half golf cart. Under 20 MPH, the car usually used just the battery, and the engine was often merely a battery charger. It had about a mile worth of battery, so not worth adding an outlet to the car. 

Checked in, set up tent. Van life lady had the site between mine and the bathroom building, in a white German-brand van. She spent all day on the phone. Sitting in the van's driver seat. Mouth opening rapidly, right arm waving around the van cabin, while the left held cell phone to ear. She was furious at someone. Another woman was staying in the site across the loop's road. "Is this water potable?" she asked to the camp host, as he drove past in his red and black electric wheelchair. He was wearing a red men's shirt with ivory-colored plastic buttons, and khaki shorts. White socks went into blue sneakers. Speaking from under his tan brimmed hat, he answered, "Yes. I've been drinking it for months. The park has overwhelming aerators, but if you let it sit, it will clear." The water hookup sprayed a thick white liquid. I filled up a gallon jug, and sat it on top of my site's electric hookup tower. After 10 minutes, the water had become transparent, and after 10 more it was completely clear. Amazing aeration indeed! A man joined the woman across the loop from the bathroom - newlyweds, she had told me earlier - they were from Portland and were bicycling to the other Portland as their honeymoon. 

Wind picked up just as I finished staking in the little orange tent. 20 MPH with gusts up to 28 MPH. Made me mad that I waited this long, and wasted a day. I watched riff videos all day. It was a Friday night, so after the wind let up, I set up the laptops on the car's back window and did the evening approvals and reports. Then cooked dinner and watched another riff movie. 

Rails were about half a mile away. Plymouth was lucky to have an underpass, so the train didn't need to blow its horn-whistle. But still, I could felt the cars - and I started to realize an audible difference, noticing that this train felt like it had lower frequencies than the previous train. As though it were laden and the previous were unladen. Not sure how a mixed train would sound, but there was room for audio analysis. It reminded me of the car engine audio diagnostic technology that I had created in 2019, and still hadn't fully developed nor monetized. This technology slowed down engine sounds, letting you hear each individual compression in great detail. 

Overnight bathroom trip. There's a truck parked at the bathroom building. That's odd. Inside, a guy with a brown beard over a white turtle neck is digging through a paper map, trying to find a location. He didn't see me. Inside, someone is sitting quietly in the shower stall. That's odd. I sat in a stall, as one does. After some time, the person in the shower stall exited. After washing my hands, I noticed numerous new clothes tags strewn across the shower stall's bench and floor. That's odd - almost like someone just committed a crime, and is performing a change of outfit before fleeing north into a no-pursuit State. And didn't want to leave a search history. Exiting the bathroom building revealed two guys with beards in the truck, looking at the same paper map. Making my way back to my campground, and I felt an odd sort of urgency, like I didn't want to be caught in their headlights. They drove out of the campground, slowly, as though they were looking for someone who might have witnessed them. 

After an otherwise quiet night, I woke up to see the sun rise over the Horse Hill mountain range. Life was good. It wasn't always simple, it wasn't always easy, and it wasn't always fast, but it was good.

# Richland Interlude 3 - Manifest Abundance in the Growth Mindset to Manifest Destiny.

Back at the MotelCo in Richland and it was geting hot - creeping up to 90 F, with predictions of 100+ F red flag weather for the next week. One of my personal maxims was: "Life is a zero-sum game to everyone except people who can make new stuff, for whom it's zero-sum plus the new stuff we make." And so I completed the off-grid kit: This kit was 5 pieces, and combined with sales tax cost more than a week of "rent" at most motels during the season. And more than half of the money in my bank account. "It's an adventure" I told myself, feeling slightly intoxicated with the rush of assembling this system that I did not knew if it would work, and committing to working from it without testing. I was painfully aware that this cost so much that I couldn't afford to stay in any motel the next week, and being a homeless person meant I didn't have a residence to fall back into. So if it didn't work, then I couldn't work - and If I couldn't work, then I wouldn't eat. 

An off-grid kit was 3 parts - charge, discharge, and a "bucket" to hold the energy to be discharged. The "shape" of the electricity was modified by a regulator or controller to better fit into the battery. Electricity was a 3-dimensional object, but not the same 3 dimensions that lumber was sold in. Instead, electricity was measured in Amps, Volts, and time. Machines consumed Amps of current at Volts of electric pressure to perform Watts of work. While Volts times Amps equals Watts on paper, the three weren't exactly the same in reality. To restate in Javascript, == but not ===. The regulator brought the solar panel electricity up or down to 10-14 Volts - a volt higher than the battery output - at the reduction of the Amps delivered. Volts times Amps would make a rectangle, and while the regulator changed both dimensions, it kept the total area almost the same, with each device involved in the process skimming as little area as possible. Like a small energy tax, to power itself. The panel and regulator performed the same job as a 6 Amp wall charger, but using the sun as the wall plug. Discharge was performed by the inverter - voltage was like pressure pushing electrons through the wire, and the inverter took the "low-pressure" 12 Volt electricity, and pressurized it up to 120 Volts. Amps were electrical current, held magnetically between literal physical electrons being pushed through the wire at a snail's pace. "Pressurizing" the electricity in this way takes 10x as many Amps (and slightly more) of physical electrons than were drawn from the inverter's 120V socket. Large cables were needed to connect the inverter and battery, allowing these dozens of Amps to flow freely. The "bucket" was a 420 Watt-hour battery, which the solar panel should charge in about 4.5 to 5 hours. The inverter wound up being oversized - in hindsight, I would recommend an inverter that takes about 1 hour to discharge the battery at full output. So this 420 Watt-hour battery should be paired with a 400 to 500 Watt inverter, and a 1000 Watt inverter like this should be paired with about a 1 kWh battery. 

Inside the bulk hardware outlet, I crossed the store a couple of times. This wasn't a single product, or even a number of products on the same aisle. Solar items were on Aisle 4, with panels, accessories, and 12 Volt batteries that looked too small for a car. Meanwhile, Aisle 10 held automotive and towing accessories, including the inverter and inverter cables. I had worked out the basic design years ago, had just asked a friend I had known since high school to verify, and it was time. I grabbed a 1000 Watt pure sine inverter - advised by the friend, a commercial kichen installer with a large off-grid kit, to get pure sine over a cheaper regular inverter - and chose the 3 foot 2/0 gauge cables over the 6 foot 2 gauge cables. "That would be $511.32," said the clerk, continuing, "and I don't know anything about solar. If you need help, Jim in the back might know." I had to describe what I was building, to explain why I was going back and forth between aisles 4 and 10. "...and so I'm going off-grid in a hybrid," I quickly related. The cashier just grinned as he waited for the POS to process my payment. 

Another customer overheard, while standing near the door, and asked, "Is it a plug-in hybrid?" 

"Nope. It gets 50 MPG" I replied as I exited. 

"Oh, nice. My non-hybrid sedan gets 42 MPG, " he stated, staying inside as the automatic door separated us. I loaded my purchases into my car in the bright sun with whiplash at how fast the conversation had changed. But it made clear that the other customer didn't know about charging cars with solar, as most would take 6 panels charging for 10 hours to fill up - a single panel wouldn't cut it. And that the other customer would do anything to win an argument. 

Assembling this into the back of my car in the MotelCo parking lot took almost all day. It might have been the new US Federal holiday, which was still struggling for American acceptance. Partially because its name sounded like a Pidgin word or portmanteau, instead of a word from a major natural language. And partially because the American Republic persisted as the Hawthorne Experiment multiplied by the Edesl Disaster. The large, bulky wires fit like a glove on the inverter, but barely didn't fit on the battery. So back to the hardware outlet for a grinding stone for the drill. No vice, so I held the wires and drill against a tote in a certain way, which let me grind off just enough to make reasonable contact with the terminal. 

"GRRrrRRrrRRrrRRrr" growled the griding stone against the wire's bracket. I was extremely happy that the front desk never came out to tell me to stop, especially when I was blocking the sidewalk between the building and the parking lot. Add washers, hand-tighten bolts, and it looked ready. With the kit bolted together, I plugged in a laptop just long enough to see the "charging" light illuminate, to make sure it worked on a fundamental level. A deeper test would have to wait until later - I was irrationally afraid of someone stealing part of it, or it not working. "Have the courage to academically research that which you fear" was one of my personal maxims. And research said it should work, but research and practice were not the same. I couldn't afford to replace anything that didn't work or was broken, so I kept my car locked and checked on it hourly until bedtime.

I might have been at least subconsiously inspired by my Sprague encounter with the Wildguy - was he one of my "Joneses" to keep up with? Completing the kit meant conversation with the friend moved onto other topics, and I might have scolded him for not researching Uniformitarianism and its use in the century-old coverup of the Potholes Site with the Potholes Reservoir. Sigh.

The room I had been staying in this week was in the breezeway, right across from the house laundry's dryer vent. Despite having nearly the cheapest electricity in the world - between the Columbia's dozen gigawatts of hydropower, and the Department of Energy's "Radiation Town" with the still-operating Hanford site and nearby private operators both providing nuclear-derived gigawatts - methane was still widely used for large heating and drying devices in Richland. The hot water tank in the place I stayed last winter was methane-powered, and so was the house laundry system here. So I'd been breathing more than a bit of methane and methane accessories. I had put my Battle Violets on the ground, so they could gather natural light from the doorway instead of window-filtered light, but their flowers started to become injured. Later that night, I felt a sharp, stabbing pain in my lung - the old familiar COVID sting. It was my 10th time catching it - where was my punch card?

I kept debating - should I take apart the off-grid kit and get my money back, and tough it out in Richland? No, I argued with myself, I couldn't afford to stay here for the next 4 months. And I wouldn't have any fun, being trapped inside air-conditioned spaces all of the time. I really liked being outdoors. But if something went wrong, I wouldn't have a way to pay for both a tow truck and hotel, let alone car repairs. And that's why I was going, I told myself, because I couldn't afford to stay. It's not about being right or wrong. It's about being time.

# Moving Away To The Sea 

Morning occurred, then coffee occurred. It was a calendar Friday. Did the morning approvals, work break for a bowl of kid's cereal, then packed up into the tote system and departed. "What am I doing?" I asked myself, then after fueling up at a mom-and-pop on Edison, I told myself "It's an adventure" and headed south along US-395.

"Why is your car so loud and so slow?" Asked an anime girl on a sticker on my car's rear window. It was partially peeled off, because Seattle hosted many liberals with Pride in not respecting property rights, at least while I lived there in 2023. Including the people delivering stuff to the car detailing businesses operating out of the garages in the city. It was where my previous American flag magnet went also, because liberals celebrate personal Pride while villainizing Pride in our nation. One of my personal maxims is "Money moves from the Right to the Left," as the Right were frequently business owners and concerned with personal accountability, and the Left were frequently charity owners and concerned with social harmony. But they didn't touch the refrigerator alphabet magnets that spelled out "Not Lost Quest" in an unusual pattern to the right of the license plate, nor the Team Bigfoot sticker to the left of it. The other reason I had an American flag on top of my car's trunk was to stand out to conservatives in their trucks too lifted to tow without an adapter, who might otherwise confuse me for a liberal and give me the rolled coal greeting. But in the moment, doing merely 70 MPH, I was embarassed to even have the sticker. Every kind of vehicle, from electric SUV to lifted diesel truck towing a camping trailer, was passing me as I fretted over my wheel bearing. 

    ....N
    ...LO
    QUEST

WA-14 ran along the southern edge of the State border with Oregon, from Vancouver to Plymouth, and was always a glorious drive. But the highway was poorly maintained in parts, and with every rough patch, my brain visualized the bearing slowly grinding into shavings. The day before, I had gone to the dealership for a wheel bearing replacement. Back in my youth, this was a simple operation for a shade tree mechanic: Unbolt the wheel hub and pull it off the spindle, then pull out the bearings, pack the new ones (by hand, without gloves) and seat them into the wheel hub, then slide the hub back onto the spindle, and tighten the hub bolt. Me and my father used to do this on summer weekends in the 90s. But for my futuristic hybrid, this was a several-hour operation for a trained professional that would cost me almost 2 weeks of motel "rent". Its bearing was pressed into a housing with a hydraulic press, before this assembly was pressed into the wheel hub. So replacing it required dismantling the entire wheel knuckle and extracting the hub assembly. Then unpressing the bearing housing from the hub - destroying the existing bearing in the process. Finally, a new bearing would be pressed into the housing. The housing would then be pressed into the hub, before reassembling the wheel knuckle and performing a front end alignment. Reducing MPG was a potential symptom of bearing failure, and my 50 miles per gallon (MPG) hybrid was getting closer to 48 MPG in Richland, and was as low as 42 MPG after a tank of gas from the Moses Lake Pleasantway. Any MPG lower than 50 made me worry. 

This State had 2 kinds of area - production (pleasant & economically useful), and tourist (breathtaking & economically useless). The Columbia Gorge here was the second kind, with many steep cliffs and few flat areas bordering the river-lake. Additionally, since it techincally passed the Cascades, and bordered a few of the State's 64 mountain ranges - including the foothills of St. Helens and Adams - these mountain ranges prevent many highways from intersecting this area. The highway and connecting access roads were sparsely populated, and at times, mine was the only visible car. Usually this filled me with a certain delight - being able to see for miles in every direction, and being the only human on Earth that I could see. Bonus points if there were no buildings, fences, or other player-created structures in sight as well. But this time it filled me with anxiety. I sure hoped that the bearing didn't go out in a place without signal, as it might be days before I could get a tow.

2 hours of driving had put me into Klickitat County, where the State highway maintenance was better, and a smoother road surface made me forget about my bearing by the time I arrived. Maryhill was more laid back, but still felt kinda like an ACOE park, because it was a joint operation betwen the State and Federal agencies. Individual campsites were close together in tight rings, while the group camp sprawled at the far end of a field. I could hear eastern European music coming from the group camping area, and heard Cyrillic accents when I was near the bathrooom building. "Slava Ukraini" showed up on my phone's list of Wi-Fi networks. That's cool - camping should be for everyone, not just US Americans. 

Signs on several locations said not to put tents on the grass, so mine went onto the crunchy gravel. Green stove on table, and I was home. The discomfort in my chest wasn't getting bad like it had in previous COVID infections. Maybe this was the difference of having almost no viral load? When staying in a motel or apartment, the COVID particles build up inside the enclosed space. But here, these microscopic macro-molecules mostly meandered out of my tent and over the Columbia. For dragonflies and mosquitos to inhale. That night, I could hear the trains on both sides of the river-lake, and could felt the laden cars through my air mattress.

# Stratify, Stratify

The next morning, I proudly set my panel out to charge - and learned that my neighbor didn't respect boundaries. His 3 kids, and the 3 kids of his guest, were playing between his campsite and mine - a tight fit next to the bushes - and kept hitting my panel with their soccer ball and flying airplane. Well, no reason to stay, best to head out. "I don't have conviction, so much as disapparation," was one of my personal maxims. I was happy to let the camp host and next guest deal with this family.

The Columbia Gorge passed through 5 different agricultural regions, and continuous transition was amazing to behold. While the area east of Maryhill was mostly covered by golden grasses and small bushes, the area west transitioned into trees, and then forests. WA-14 went up several hundred feet in elevation as it passed over the Columbia range, giving the most amazing vistas of the river-lakes and Oregon. I called it a river-lake because parts of it were wider than parts of most of the lakes in the State. As a series of bodies of water, their continuous grandeur proved overwhelming to witness, let alone recount. After a few years of traveling the State, I had started to run out of unique superlatives. Topping these were the dams of overwhelming scope and stature, meant to bind and utlize the river's energy, not unlike an Orwellian elephant in India from a century ago. Such as McNary lock and dam hear US-395, and the John Day lock and dam about 5 miles upriver from Maryhill. There were a few rest areas and view points, but most of it had to experienced while moving down the highway. Not far from Maryhill sat Dallesport, a long break in the river-across the river from The Dalles of Oregon Trail fame. Slightly upriver from the city of The Dalles sat The Dalles lock and dam. The mostly-westbound river made a broad curve south and then back north, leaving a flat plain downhill from the Columbia foothills. Green grasses covered the landscape. This area seemed underdeveloped from the highway, as though the small town should be a small city. 

After an hour or so, the trees become more or less forest. Having lived in the Seattle region for more than 40 years, this felt like another "tree canyon", not unlike the "skyscraper canyons" that city dissenters frequently bemoaned. 

Home Valley was in less-populated Skamania County, and the campground had 2 huge baseball fields, to host little league tournaments between Richland and Portland, among others. Players usually stayed in the campground, the camp host told me, or maybe Vancouver an hour to the west. These were really the only choices for lodging around here. That's when it dawned on me: camping wasn't an activity or a destination, but a stratification of lodging, alongside hotelling, apartmenting, and house dwelling. A stratification that the Seattle region largely didn't allow to exist. To paraphrase Thoreau, "stratify, stratify," was one of my personal maxims. Homeless people still "stratify downward" to this level of lodging and seek cheaper shelter when the need arose, in public parks as we should. The way to end homelessness was to allow tents on public property - in exchange for a small fee, some level of security or protection service, and possibly even mail delivery. Maybe have a fund to pay the fee for those few who couldn't afford it, as most homeless had gainful employment. But instead of collecting a fee, the SP&R employees would call the blue-and-whites to remove them as tresspassers. And most of these hapless people would get sucked into the various Downtown and SoDo charities that existed to "help" with the "homeless problem" while paying very high salaries to their directors and executives. The real problem that people in Seattle had was carlessness - having gone without a motor vehicle for 3 years while living in Seattle, and later being homeless with car across the State for 3 years, I would choose being homeless with car every single time.

Home Valley campground sat under a forest canopy, giving a great view of the Columbia gorge from the southwest to the southeast. Almost all of Skamania County's population was along WA-14, and this campground was no exception. "Skamania" was a native word or phrase meaning "river rapids" and had no connection with the musical genre. I arrived around 1 PM, about 3 hours before the check-in time of 4 PM. But the campsite was empty and the host very friendly, and I found myself checked-in early. "Looks like I'll be your neighbor for the next day or so," I declared to the van-life male-female couple in the site next to me, and deployed the green stove and orange tent. The male of the male-female couple had white hair and was sitting outside on a folding chair, wearing a black "Bigfoot Exists" t-shirt over green shorts. Making a cup of coffee, I tried to hide the cough that had developed since leaving Richland. But they packed up and departed in their Class B RV within the hour. I guessed I was wrong earlier. 

"Is this really my life?" I thought to myself as I sat in the shade, enjoying the afternoon. Few of the campsites had direct sun, and mine got none. I could goto the day use area and charge my battery, but I was content here, watching the river go past through the few trees near the shore. At one point, I looked up and saw a large crow flying west past me. I took it for a sign that I was on the right path, and should continue heading toward the coast. At some point, I realized that the salted butter I was using was a huge source of sodium, and decided to buy unsalted when this ran out. I could toss this and get that now, but thought I should save the $5 and just watch my butter intake.

Instead of a permanent bathroom building, or a vault toilet, this campground had 2 portable toilets every few campsites. At some point, I realized that a portable toilet was an upsized composting toilet. And that a vault toilet was a large and permanent one of these - like a septic tank with a toilet that drops directly into the tank instead of flushing.  Some Internet videos of rural China featured homes with vault toilets in the 21st Century - one had the toilet as a hole in the floor in the middle of the kitchen, a very unsanitary situation. Having grown up in a 20th Century house with a septic tank in lieu of local sewers, this realization made me glad to have had flush toilets in our suburban home instead of vault toilets. 

After sunset, the chugg-a-chugg-a-chugg of a big rig woke me, and I could hear both the camp host and a woman yelling parking instructions at the driver. I was too tired to get off the air mattress and learn more.

# Best Laid Plans

In the morning, the big rig turned out to be an ambulance conversion, with the oversized ambulance box painted pale, and all of the emergency lights blacked out. The lack of emergency markers and single-color box made the black truck frame carrying them seem more pronounced, and the whole vehicle seem larger. The two women seemed to be doing the van life, and emerged in the late morning with breakfast essentials. One had pulled a 5 gallon water jug from one of the storage compartments on the outside of the ambu-van, while the other got pancake mix into a bowl on their site's picnic table. I had made kid's cereal for breakfast as coffee water boiled, and sat in my rope throne, behind to my trunk. Basically In my ktichen, the best place for a servile like me. Little black ants had ascended onto my car, and were scouting through my kit. These were the ones that walked in zig-zagging paths. I had lived with investations of these gentle, tiny wild animals in the past and since, and here was no different. They could smell the sugar in my food, but couldn't quite find the source of the sweet smell. Their miniscule antennas swang back and forth to follow my plastic round cereal bowl as I ate from it. A small dark bird with a red plume ran out of the underbrush. It stared at me intently, as though it were expecting something from me. But I hadn't thought to bring a gift for when I was a guest in its home. 

Shower was in the day use bathroom building, so I took one on the way out. I put it back after I was done. Perfect sunshine made me think about putting out the panels, but I wouldn't be here long enough to get many watt-hours, and was more afraid of panel theft. This campsite wasn't just between the rails and the river, but moreso was next to a second rail - a train car storage location. Trains would block here for long periods, uncoupling cars on the main rail, moving forward and then backwards onto the storage rail, coupling cars there, then forwards and back again to the main rail to couple with the previously-coupled cars. I wasn't sure if there were a name for this process, but the end result was that some or all of the rail cars on the other rail were mixed into the train, to travel together to the train's destination. And/or maybe some cars from the main rail got left behind on the storage rail. A side effect of this process was that road car traffic into and out of the park might be blocked for, you know, a long time. Some of this activity may have occurred while I was showering. The cute AmerailWays trains went past here too, but there was no platform to stop and exchange passengers. 

The cannabis cartridges from the Pasco cannibissary (State-regulated cannabis dispensary) were nearly empty, and I saw a neat looking cannibissary just off the highway. Cannabis "lubricated" my thoughts, and without it, I'd revert into a helpless paranoia-stricken mess. This gave the product a certain Maslowian priority in my finances. So I stopped in for 3 more cartridges, flirted with the pretty lady selling them, and was back on the road. Don't drive high - and don't drive low. South of the Bonneville dam, the Columbia became an actual river again. One of the impacts of this was that the river level rose about 4 feet during each high tide in Vancouver. The occasional barge passed by, shipping logs and timber from Idaho out across the Pacific. These logs had largely supplanted the logs that used to pass through Aberdeen, since the Spotted Owl on the West Coast became endangered. WA-14 went through Camas before Vancouver, and the tree canyons slowly gave way to suburban sprawl, then an urban grid. Fun fact: The first settlers in Seattle - Alki-New York they called it - didn't know about tides, and lost all of their supplies to the high tide. They only survived due to Native charity.

Rolling into Vancouver, I had made reservations at the MotelCo for Monday and Tuesday, and then Wednesday morning would be payday. Direct depost usually reached my credit union before 3am. Almost out of money, I figured that I had enough for both nights. I stopped at a an ATM and got out a $20, then went to a laundromat and broke it into quarters. Wash and dry only used $6, so I put the rest into the little coin storage drawer in my car. It was where I kept my mailbox key too. 

Back to the MotelCo and into the office. I walked in with hope in my heart. The lobby here was pristine, with new tile floors, new marble countertops for the check-in counter, and a new coffee service display.  The lobby was lit mostly by a large TV on the far side. As I approached the counter, a woman slowly walked over to meet me.

"I don't see your reservation," said the woman at the counter, gruffly. She was wearing the blue corporate polo over black pants. Being in a border town of Portland and within the metropolitan area, they got a lot of scammers, and she wasn't taking any nonsense. I froze in panic, realizing that today was a calendar Sunday, not a calendar Monday. I thanked the woman at the counter and exited the office with rage in my heart. I went to my car to work through the grief stage of anger, and then accepted that I would not be staying at MotelCo that week. But I was desperate to sleep inside for some reason. So I bargained with Maps, and I was lucky to find somewhere forgettable to stay while I divined my next few stays on this journey. I could hear the train, in the distance, late at night. It showed up in my dreams, far in the distance.

# No Idea Why They Came To Me 

The next morning, after visiting WinHeart, I tried to stop by the Vancouver transfer station and dispose of my propane cansiters. These things were easy to buy yet almost impossible to leave behind, didn't stack into the tote system, and had to be kept upright. I had several. Input the transfer station into the map app and I was waiting in the left turn lane before I knew it. And waiting. A car turned, so now I was 6th in the left turn lane. One song on the radio ended and another began. Oncoming traffic would slow to a trickle before a red light released another torrent of motor vehicles. And waiting. The oncoming right-turn traffic into the transfer station was going much faster, but streched down the street and around a corner. Would that be a longer wait? Another song started playing - this was worse than 4th Ave in Seattle, where I had waited through 4 green lights in 1 block in 2019. Another song started, and I looked in my right-side mirror for a gap in the traffic. I gave up on the transfer station and kept heading north.

The second part of my plan was to stay at nearby Paradise Point State Park. This was a paradise that should have been paved into a parking lot. First, getting here was a hassle as Maps said to park along the limited-access I-5 highway and hop a couple of fences to enter. So I drove another 15 minutes to the next off-ramp, serving Woodland, then back south. Getting back to the outskirts of Battle Ground, it was about time for the Tuesday afternoon meeting at work, so I found a random parking lot. This was basically our Monday morning meeting, but Monday morning was when the reocurring skip-level team meeting - between my skip-level director and his team of subordinate managers - had been scheduled, years before my team and role were formed. Walking to my trunk, I powered on the inverter, then the laptop. Signed in and joined an almost-empty voice chat room. A couple of coworkers were there, but my manager and my project manager were out of office. Still, it felt cool to be in a meeting from some random parking lot. Like I had a new super power.

After the meeting, I pulled gently slalomed the car through the double roundabout overpass, and then into the campground. Most of the park was closed for construction, including the whole day use area. No left turns, only right turns into the main loop. And so I turned right. The campsites were less than 100 feet from I-5, and the huge hill helped us guests to learn why most municipalities ban the use of unmuffled compression brakes. Using these brakes might be an automatic feature on some trucks, as it was on my car. "WHAM-A-WHAM-A-WHAM-A-WHAM-A-WHAM-A-WHAM" screamed past another truck, converting forward motion velocity into engine rotaitonal velocity. The campsites were along a gentler continuous hill, but unlilke Fishhook, the sites weren't carved into it - they all sloped too. I set up the orange tent in the only part of the site that seemed to have shade - right by the campground loop road. Looking at the full-shade site to my right made me regret reserving before arriving, as I could have had shade. But I toughed it out by keeping my trunk lid between me and the sun, huddling in the small box of shade as I watched a riff movie.

Later that afternoon, 2 other guests exited the showers and approached me - across the small street from the bathroom and shower building - and not the people staying to the south. To the north, down the slope, was a 1970s RV trailer - the 20-something owner had left early that morning in a 1970s outfit, 1970s haircut, and 1970s truck - as though he lived far and had to work nearby. Or knew where to find the time travel portal. These 2 guests asked me if I had seen anyone moving shoes - they had left their shoes outside the shower (as one does?) and when they came out, their shoes were missing. Found in the trash can. Personally, I wore flip-flops into the shower, just like I did at gyms. 

"Sorry, I have no idea." I told them. I was also answering my own unspoken question: "why are you telling this to me and not the park ranger?"

This site had hookups, so I stayed until late morning to finish up the Monday morning approval and to-work sets, then struck camp and headed back south. Not sleeping well here added to my confusion. I misplaced about half a dozen items, but later found each of them in odd places. Like a USB drive in a small space next to my trunk latch. 

# The Gods Saw Fit To Grace Me With A Spare

The third part of my plan was to stay at Home Valley again, using the $8 in dollar bills and $14 in quarters that I still had to my name, since the site itself was only $20/night. The fiancial institution said my account held $1.24, but I wasn't going to bother trying to get that out. An hour back south, then another half-hour backtracking east. I had no idea what was going on with my wheel bearing, but it would just have to hold up. And no idea of the shape of the software repository that I worked from - I was eating up time more than anything else. I served at the pleasure of the community, so if I didn't keep the approvals flowing, then it might eventually cause employment issues. 

The host at Home Valley was still more than friendly, explaining that at his campsite everything had to be online and required an $8 fee. Calling me over to his picnic table, he counted out the quarters. It was the decision of the group that ran these parks, he explained. But nearby Big Cedars still took cash payments without reservations. He bought my quarters and donated to my cause, giving me a $20 before sending me on my way. I got to my car before he called me back.

"Now it was 30 miles to get there, and 30 back - do you have gas?" asked the host, trying to catch anything we'd missed. For a lot of trucks and gas-powered SUVs, this could take 5-6 gallons or another $20 in fuel. "It has a few gallons and gets 50 MPG," I replied, pointing to my car, "so it says 179 miles remaining." The camp host grinned and wished me well. 

"It's an adventure," I told myself. So it was a half-hour drove back east, and north, into a national forest. This campground was about a mile past the national forest campground, and while the national forest campground had bear warnings, Big Cedars had none. Living up to its name, Big Cedars had massive cedar trees with a massive canopy overhead. A Fed-Ups delivery truck followed me up into the campsite. You know, Fed-Ups - The Package Handlers. 90% of the packages in the truck were probably from that river company. The host would later tell me that the driver took his work breaks there, and I approved wholeheartedly. But I did not approve the no signal situation - the first time that I've had network issues in over a year. I tried in a couple of spots, so up went the hotspot. I had set up a continuous ping on a laptop. Here a ping packet. There a ping packet. Everywhere just one ping packet. Shifted a few inches and got a few packets in a row...but not enough to load a weather app website. Backed the car a foot with the trunk open, very dangerous, no packets. And so after setting up the little orange tent and green stove, it was the 30 minute drive back to Home Valley for the evening part of my "part-time" job. 

I passed a turn-off where I could feasibly unfold out the panels and work while standing over my trunk. It was a gravel turn-out with a narrow, beautiful vista of the river-lake and Wygant Natural Area on the far shore. But working from the side of the road wasn't really safe. My kit might seem to work from literally anywhere, but really it had to be a parking lot with good signal and a mix of sun and shade. Drove back, through the same amazing section of Columbia Gorge. "Is this really my life?" I asked myself. 

Pulling the Sodo Boso around to Home Valley's day use area, I hoisted the 5G tote. The innovation of putting the hotspot into its own tote suggested itself, and it balanced nicely on top of my car's rear license plate when the trunk was open. It started to feel like a movie from 25 years ago, where the main characters had to park their futuristic vehicle somewhere with good signal so they could connect. But the flying robot death squads in our collective reality weren't yet hunting me down, and the sky was still usually a bright blue. With the panel out and good signal, I pulled out my rope throne and TV tray from my futuristic vehicle, and got to work. Inverter "wall" plug being located just behind the fridge-cooler meant my kitchen-in-trunk had also become my home office...err homeless office? 

Got the approvals done, at least, and tried to make some progress on the to-work set, before sending a small apology about my day with the daily report. Then east along WA-14 to the turn-off, and north from there, through the towns of Mill A and Willard, into the National Forest, past the National Forest campground, past the few private residences, and into the campsite. The only meat I had left was bacon, so I fried it up and ate it with some rice. I meant to soak it in water, to remove some of the salt, but forgot. A famous musician's bacon cooking style came to mind - throw a chunk of bacon in the pan and basically leave it alone until it was all fried. A key here was starting with the bacon slices on their sides, which kept most of each slice elevated out of the grease in the pan. Bacon's natural curling as it fried would much the same. The musician had been a cannabis user for most of his life, which probably inspired this particular cooking "innovation" of getting high in another room while the bacon was frying, instead of closely watching it and trying to flatten the slices against the pan.

Crickets. The overwhelmingly loud pulses were almost hypnotic. My tree pollen allergy was acting up, because some of the many cedar trees were males and produced pollen. Females produced fruits and nuts around their seeds. The bathroom building had very dim lights, and I could barely see there and back on my first trip, while the sky was still light. I wasn't sure why, but I used the bathroom 2-3 times each night. I became a light sleeper in 2014, when I had a tech job with a particularly demanding oncall duty. A text message would frequently wake me at around 3 AM, to restart a sundry service on a random website server, every few nights for a few weeks. I suspected that the bathroom trips were how my body got rid of the extra sodium, and possibly other excess molecules. My first bathroom trip went okay - but it was getting dark, and the still-lit sky was barely visible through the trees. The bathroom building had oddly dim outdoor lighting and I could barely see the ADA-approved paved sidewalk trail around the building. For the second trip, it was too dark to see the path, so I went to get my phone out of my car - and OH GOD MY LEG! Dull shooting pain throbbed through my lower left leg and washed up against my very high pain tolerance, nearly overflowing. I had tripped over the parking curb or something in the dark, and landed on a rock or something, My left leg hurt like crazy. Body reminded me that the right leg felt great, which was little consolation. Rolling around on my back next to my car, I couldn't see to told how badly I had injured myself. But I could still get up and hobble around in shock, put some weight on it - good, bone probably wasn't broken. Found the picnic table and sat on the bench, then traced my finger down my bone - I was terrified that my body would make me stop due to damage. Trace...trace...trace...no pain. All of the pain was next to it, in the calf muscle. Beautiful. For painful skies. For amber waves across unbroken bone. It could heal on its own, which was free. I knew that I would be limping for at least a week. Doctors and hospitals would cost more money than I had at that point. I walked off the adrenaline and shock by pacing a circle between the tent and the table for a few minutes, then got my phone out of my car and limped to the toilet. After all of that, I still had to "go". 

# Kelso Interlude - Take Two

Waking up, I felt great, until I needed to get off the mattress. Bladder and leg fought in my head, and bladder eventually won. After waking, I made coffee and oatmeal, then struck camp and headed back south, then back west to Home Valley. The campgrounds shared the same shower, and I was told that the same code would work, but today it did not. So I limped back to my car and deployed my office. Taking a break, I made reservations for a week in Kelso - I would be needing it. After working on the morning approvals, I packed up and headed back west to Vancouver again, and then back north. Past the Paradise In Name Only and into Kelso. 

"Do you want east side or west side?" Asked the guy at the front desk, through the plastic window. He was dressed in the MotelCo blue polo and black pants. 

"East side," I said out of habit. It was where I lived, both in general and also in this building. 

Much of this stay passed in a blur, as I felt stunned from the injuries in my leg, chest, and hand. Battle Violets guarded the north-facing window with vigilence. 

# Big Game Hunters

The 1909 camping book mentioned bringing a gun several times. For scaring off animals that might have wandered into camp, and to help other animals not make the same mistake. Camping, as the book described, meant choosing a random bit of wilderness for the campsite. It said to shoot into the air, and that might have been okay in the early 20th Century, before the human population of Earth reached 2 billion. But with today's more than 8 billion humans, the falling bullet might hit someone, and shooting into the ground would be somewhat safer. Lastly, emergency signalling - the book mentioned several times that people would simply wander off, and that book's author admitted that he sometimes obsessed over birds and would chase them through the brush, just to get a better look - and then realize that he was completely lost, shooting off 3 shots into the air as a signal for help. Modern mass-produced pea whistles had been developed only about 40 years before that book's publishing, so might not have had the industrial production nor widespread availability of a 21st Century lifeguard's whistle. The menace of "that one person at the rave with a whistle" wasn't yet a vision in Sousa's head. Limping down the seasonal aisle took me past lifeguard whistles, phone floaties, and foam dart guns. 

I didn't carry a gun because my exotic weapons proficiency meant that I didn't need to carry dedicated weaponry. The forest presented to me as many weapons as a suburban kitchen or a mechanic's garage. Also, I didn't own anything valuable enough to need that level of protection. Even my more expensive items, like my laptops, were dented and damaged. Two were missing original feet, and one was missing a replacement foot. Each of my phones had a cracked screen. I would "bend it until it broke," then mend it and bend again, until it broke again, then cycle mend & bend. Pushing each thing past its limits. Limit break? Limit broke. Each of my cooking utensils were caked with grease and most were speckled with a touch of rust. A gun would be just another valuable object that I would have to hide and worry about rusting, like my combination axe and my santoku ("triply useful") knife. Were kleptomaniacs to review my kit, most would quickly realize that anything I owned could be more easily five-finger discounted during a quick retail experience at the nearest city, than by burgling me. Plus, then they wouldn't end up with my "signature" rust, dents, and cracks. Walking past the cooking devices aisle made me consider replacing my santoku knife with an unrusted one.

The book also discussed hunters shooting wild game - while not widely popular back then, this was the original "gaming", and also an important source of food. It was part of what let the Lewis and Clark expedition party of 45 operate for 2.36 years on $2324 in supplies - 2024 equivalent of $64,485.45 or $1.66 per person per day. Along with picking berries, fishing, eating dandelions, trapping squirrels & birds, and learning about new foods like camas. Supplemented by invasive species including mullberries and Himalayan blackberries. Living for under $2/day in 2024 in the USA required ignoring that so many grocery stores and fast food restauraunts were within an hour's drive on almost any highway. And foregoing State-wide $16.28/hour minimum wage in favor of basic hunter-gatherer ayutarky. I limped through this grocery store's meat section, picking out pork chops and steaks. This time, I got flatiron instead of chuck steaks. 

So much food had sodium in it, I'd been starting to realize. I've lived mostly on frozen and fast foods for the past several years, but this had to change. I limped my across the grocery store, turning boxes around and flipping the flaps on bags, looking at the nutrition labels on my favorite foods. The sodium content of each was shocking - 15-20% per serving, with 3-5 servings per package on some. Since the percentage was out of the total sodium recommendation, I was adding to my sodium number through the day. I tried not to go over 100% per day, which 5 servings of 20% would take up entirely. I'd eaten a week's worth of sodium on some days, I learned. Rolling the cart past a packaged food aisle, I racked my brain, trying to think about foods that didn't have sodium. "Bread and soup are great places to hide all kinds of unhealthy stuff, including sugar and salt," was one of my personal maxims. So both were right out. This eliminated nearly 1/2 of the store, as I acted like the canned, frozen, and bakery sections didn't exist, moving directly from produce to water to dairy to meat. Detoured through the center for coffee, rice, oatmeal, and pasta, then checkout. This traced nearly the outline of the store, which my Home Ec teacher told the class was the healthiest way to shop, back in the 90s. 

"Go see a doctor," my dentist had begged me, months earlier. "I'm just saying that the last guy whose blood pressure was that high, had a stroke a week later." I knew what a doctor would tell me - start with a low-sodium diet and go from there. I didn't need to pay hundreds of dollars to a private practice to hear someone say it, along with their scolding about my not having health insurance. While it might have sounded like they were concerned about my apparent lack of financial concern for my long-term health, frequently they seemed to be more concerned that they couldn't maximize their medical billing against whichever insurance company I would choose to provide for them. Not due to some grudge against the healthcare and medical billing industries, but it was cheaper for me to not have health insurance. Being a part-time worker with a relatively high hourly rate meant I was required to spend nearly a tithe on health insurance, which was more per month than I spent on medical services each year. Thanks, Obama. The penalties had been later removed, saving me thousands of dollars each year if I paid doctors and dentists in cash. Thanks, Trump. Additionally, when the ACA was created, my employer at the time provided healthcare insurance through a healthcare trust. But the ACA shut these down, requiring that employer to move to a more expensive insurance provider. "We did this to help you buy health insurance," most liberals would proudly proclaim, shouting down actual reports of how their plan regularly prevented me from buying heath insurance.

I knew oatmeal didn't have sodium, which was why most people add it. Fresh meat couldn't have any, right? 4% per 4 oz, said a package of pork, which meant each pound had 16%. Limping past the pasta aisle, I look at a package of rotini, and see that it had 0% salt. Not just 0%, but 0 mg. This was good to note, as products could say 0% by rounding down, when they had 5-10 mg (0.2% to 0.41%) per serving. But I was dismayed to see that pasta sauce had about 12% per cup, and I wasn't letting myself buy anything with a double-digit percentage per serving. I thought about making my own sauce - boil tomatoes, remove the skins, add other vegetables and ingredients, the canning and storage process, sigh. Bacon and sausage were both right out, along with the entire frozen and packaged food sections. I missed frozen pizza, but 1/4 of the pizza gave more than 1/3 of the daily sodium. Just enough to make me want more, so not worth the temptation. I grabbed a box...er...tube of oatmeal to find it had 0%. Cheese had more than I liked at 7%, but I could limit myself to a slice or 2 per day. Beer and dark chocolate didn't have any. I perused the cereal aisle, saw a 1% on the store brand shredded wheat box, and grabbed that too. 

"Board rooms educate people just enough to make them into good customers," was one of my personal maxims. And I went to Samuel Clemens for a response: "Don't let schooling interfere with your education." Tell US Americans that we could only have 2,400 milligrams of sodium per day, and nobody would know what you were talking about. But tell us that we could have just 2/5 of a teaspoon of salt each day and everyone would go on a low-sodium diet. One thing I learned about sodium in college was cleaning a bong. Cannabis tar was highly non-polar, and removing this with soap and water was a diifficult chore. Back in the fraternity, another brother had broken his bong and took it to the head shop to repair or replace. The clerk sent him home, to clean the tar-coated glass first - with rubbing alcohol, a common non-polar solvent. And salt, as a diluted abrasive. Swashing this mixture around the bong quickly broke up most of the cannabis tar, allowing it to be poured out. Thinking about all of the sodium I had been eating made me visualize my blood as an abrasive substance moving through my arteries, capillaries, and veins. Like liquid sandpaper - a highly non-optimal scenario. Beyond this, there was significant concern for the excessive pressure generated by the ever-growing heart muscle, due to an excess of the sodium signalling molecule. Another molecule was cholesterol: My father had been singing the evils of eggs and cholesterol for my entire life, professing the belief that removing these from the diet would allow him to eat whatever he wanted. 

"What if the cholesterol wasn't build-up, but instead spackle?" Asked an Internet video that he didn't see. He couldn't stay awake during Internet videos, despite watching TV all day. "It was like a building inspector coming by and saying: 'This wall is full of spackle - it would hold up a lot better without all of that sealant' - which was true," the video continued, "but would leave all of the gaps in the wall...err artery." And this also put eggs back on the menu. I was in the dairy aisle and grabbed a dozen, spinning each egg to check for cracks.

"Why wash rice?" I asked myself. Rice didn't have sodium. Researching earlier had given a variety of reasons for washing, from removing any remaining dirt to moistening the rice grains. Functionally, the most significant seemed to be removing starch powder. Starch was a molecule that would dissolve into water if you let it. If you didn't, then it became more sticky. To reword, washing rice removed the starchy rice-powder that coated each grain, making it less-sticky. This was why sushi rice wasn't usually washed - to maximize stickiness and sushi layer adhesion. Looking at my bag of basmati, I could see that the grains and the side of the bag were all covered in rice powder. I knew jasmine rice usually wasn't as powdery, so shouldn't need washing, and decided to switch varieties on the next shopping trip. Researching hardtack brought out the best parts of flour: starch and gluten. Gluten stuck together due to water-activated disulfide bonds between the molecules. These bonds were hard to replace, and it was why specialty breads like potato bread might add another starch, but still had some flour. Rice was similar to corn in only having starch. So how did harina tortillas stay together? Through the weak starch bonds, said a website. At first, so much water was added that it worked as a solvent for the starch in the harina powder, and dissolved into a dough. This was flattened and allowed to dry, where the water escape was controlled. The goal was to reduce the amount of water to where it was no longer a solvent, but merely a plasticizer. Water in corn tortillas played 2 roles - the same roles as both water and lard in flour tortillas. Much the same was likely occurring in oatmeal porridge, where the water level was high enough to adhere, but low enough to not be a solvent. I grabbed a bag of jasmine.

I also got some snacks, to keep the low blood sugar at bay. These birthday cakes said they had 2% of daily sodium, and that worried me more than a high glycemic index. The glycemic index was higher apparently because the flour was a finer cake-quality grind, instead of a coarser multigrain-quality grind. I usually had 2 or 3 cakes per day, and tried to separate bites by an hour or so. I started calling them "petit eights" at some point, not unlike double-sized petit fours. 

Got a bag of ground coffee, but kept drinking instant. Coffee beans didn't have any sodium. I knew how I'd make it - almost like a French press, put 2-3 tablespoons per 8 oz of coffee into a steel camping cup, let steep for 4 minutes, stir after about 2. Then press a butter knife against the lower part of the rim and tip the cup over a coffee mug, using the knife to hold back any grounds that might be floating. Taking a note from cowboy coffee - where the grounds were sunk by dropping cold water into the heated pot of coffee, the stir in the middle frees the now-cooler grounds to sink into the liquid that they were insulating. If the cup didn't get jostled much, then most of those grounds should stay on the bottom through the pouring process. But for the Time Being, I kept using my mix of WinHeart and Walton's World instant. Both came in the same shape of plastic jar, with interchangeable lids. I put another stack of 3 into the cart.

# Can't Move The Cheese That Isn't There

The MotelCo here didn't have any microwave/fridge rooms. It was an upgrade for this motel chain, similar to ordering cheese on your burger at the hamburger royalty chain, and this location would be like a hamburger royalty location that just didn't offer cheese. Like at all, order it your way except no cheese. Protip: bring your own fridge, like I did. And so I drove up to Seaquest State Park in the foothills of Mt. St. Helens, and used their day use area to sear my pork chops and steam rice with vegetables. Names here were weird. I've never figured out which Catholic saint the mountain was named after - if it was St Helen, then why was there an S at the end? The park's name was the same as that submarine TV show with the dolphin, but I didn't think they were related. The day use area's ground was uneven and I almost fell a couple of times, limping the several feet between the table and my car. When I was a kid, I fell off my bike a lot. One Thursday afternoon, a doctor had put a straight-leg splint device on my leg, while waiting over the weekend for the radiologist to come back to the office on Tuesday. He only worked 3 days a week, what a rough career. "The leg heals best when it was held straight," that family practitioner had told me, "and the arm heals best when bent." While stirring my rice as the pork chop sizzled, I sat on the picnic table bench with my left leg also on the bench, knee straight. Any other position set off alarms in my body.

# Throbbing With Blood Flow

For the weekend, I indulged in coffee and riff videos, while catching up on some video gaming. It was nice to mindlessly guide my blocky simulacrum around a voxel-esque landscape, high on endorphins, as my elevated leg gently throbbed in convalescense. Nothing really happened, and I mostly just stuck to myself. I felt stronger each day, and travelled up to the same day use area to cook dinner. For breakfast, I would have half of a "petit eight", and the other half for lunch. As I didn't really have a good way to cook there. On Sunday, a mother with two teenage kids checked in at the far end of the building. I only noticed them because I was in my kitchen, putting ice in my coffee when they drove up and parked, before returning to my game. Monday was also excessively routine, and approvals & validations went by without incident. 

# Snail Gang

A French motorcycle gang checked in on Tuesday. They had 4 people in the room next to me, and 4 more in the room next to that one. Another 12 in 3 rooms on the other side of the building. Mix of male and female and possibly other pronouns - I didn't know enough French to tell. Out came wine glasses and a couple of bottles. Corks popped. I loudly cracked open a beer can from my fridge. "Welcome to my State," I said to the party, trying to sound friendly. But they misuderstood me and one of the guys apologized. Later, he came over to apologize again for any offense as I was moving my panels, and we got into a conversation about my solar kit. He managed to find the English words to tell me that they had started in Bellingham, and were headed south on I-5 to San Diego.

# Senior Princess Reina

In the morning, the French retreated to the road before I had my second coffee. "It's not about being right or wrong. It's about being time," I told myself. "A time for everything, and everything in its time," was another of my personal maxims. I couldn't find anywhere to stay over the 4th of July weekend - every campsite on the coast was taken, said the State Park reservation website. The National Park system didn't seem to have any campgrounds in this corner of the State. I had left Richland to flee the less-humid 100+F heat, and was now fleeing the Cascade foothills and their more-humid 90+F heat wave. And in my desperate efforts to go west, I had neglected to secure lodging. Motel checkout was just a couple of hours away. My first thought was to look for a hotel or motel, so between approvals I searched Maps: Between I-5 and the Pacific Ocean, from Olympia to Kelso, and under $100 per night. 2 results: one in Centralia and the other was the place where I was currently staying. Nothing wrong with this place, but it was time to go. Searching the website showed every campground to be either red from no available sites, or orange from no reservable sites. Most of these were orange because they had an ADA site and the filters weren't marking these as unavailable - sigh, work through the bugs. But I tapped every orange dot, just to be sure. Looking at Twin Harbors, it had 2 sides. The east side was red - full. The west side was orange. Clicking the orange icon loaded 2 loops - a west loop that was red - full. And a small loop by the highway that was all orange. Clicking on each showed "This campsite isn't reservable." Could the campground have a whole First-Come First-Served (FF) loop? I was afraid of being wrong, and being stranded on the coast for the 4th. Should I stay here? "It's an adventure," I told myself, and that the worst outcome would be sleeping in my car. As the I Ching ("Book of Change") had told me months ago, a wanderer's place was the road. And it was - time to go. 

People in Kelso acted like I was invisible while I was limping around, but once the limp faded they started being friendly, and I exchanged a few fleeting glances on my departure shopping trip. Got cartridges at a cannibissary that was converted from a residential house. So had the nail shop to the left, but the rest of the street looked like people still lived there. Got gas at the dinosaur station, and went west along WA-4. The metropolitan sprawl went on for some time along the State highway, but eventually gave way to forests and grassy floodplains. 

WA-4 traced between the languid Columbia River and the southwest coastal ranges. It was mostly a tree canyon, with trees and a layer of 1-2 individual houses on the south, between the river and the road. A narrow slit of gray sky above showed the cloudy overcast. Battle Violets ate openly, with their awning retracted. A few mailboxes dotted each mile of highway. "Becker Estate" read a large sign underneath one of the mailboxes, next to a road up to a particularly nice house on a small tree-shaded hill. To the north was a sundry mixture of individual houses, full neighborhoods, and large estates. WA-4 met US-101, the Olympia-to-Hollywood coastal logging and recreation highway, on a broad and flat plain near Naselle. Originally, I had wanted to goto Ilwaco, Cape Disappointment, and Long Beach. But I didn't have nearly as much hope in finding lodging in that area, as the campground appeared to have no FF sites. US-101 cut through the coastal forests and floodplains, staying near the Pacific coast and connecting inlets. Houses became few and far between - maybe 1 every 3-5 miles, not unlike farm houses on the east side.

An hour of driving put me in Naselle, and I turned right - north. Another hour along US-101. All the while enjoying the amazing coastal forests, rivers, and floodplains. And the anxiety of not having a place to stay when I got there. A song about risk started playing on the radio, and I took it as a sign that I was on the right path. I had been trying not to go off the deep end and risk figuratively drowning, but now I was giving myself a reason to dive in head-first. It would be more fun to swim there, right. As before, I felt almost dizzy with the rush of leaping without knowing where I was going to place my head, and kept both hands on the wheel. Confusing me more, since refueling, my car's mileage had jumped from 48 MPG to 53 MPG. Was my car . . . getting . . . better? Or more likely, was the gas from the Richland mom-and-pop inferior? I was no longer sure that my wheel bearing was going out. My head was a soup of anxiety, so I just kept driving. Could this be the wrong choice? That would be classic me. Trees flicked past at highway speeds. On the road, there was only one direction: forward; and only one thing was correct: moving forward.

Arriving in Grayland, it lived up to the name: overcast to my eyes and 72 F said the car's phone-sized screen. Just past the Shoalwater Bay Reservation and casino. Twin Harbors State Park was named after Westport, about 20 minutes to the north - and Tokeland, the first town in the State, about 35 minutes to the south. Both were great places to get fresh-off-the-boat seafood, if you didn't want to drive hours northeast to Seattle, where many Gulf of Alaska fishing vessels docked. The FF loop was mostly empty - a long-term camper with 2 tents and 2 dogs but no car in the first spot, a van-life lady in the 5th, and a couple at the far end. The long-term camper took the Grays Harbor bus, which stopped along the highway at the campground's easement, I saw later. Campsites on the other side of the loop's gravel road all had full shade. The overcast was thin enough for me to see the daystar's outline, and so I squinted at it like a POTUS. I stood on the roadside for a couple of minutes, working out the ecliptic path through the cloud layer, and the probable locations of sun and shade based on this. After staring at the sun, I got back on WA-105 for 1 block, turned right onto more WA-105, went about 2 more blocks, turned right into to campground's east side, and up to the gatehouse. Asked the gray-haired ranger about the 3rd campsite. I paid about $130 for 4 days, which was less expensive than staying for only the 4th of July would have been at any motel west of I-5. 

After a couple of hours, the van-life lady introduced herself as Reina. She told me that she was an Olympia native, but had relocated to Wyoming at some point. Retired with adult sons, she had taken up the van life as a way to stay active and see more of this expansive nation. Being a senior citizen meant her stays at National Parks were half-price. That's cool - camping should be for everyone, not just us relative youths. She invited me over to share her campfire. I still had the 2 bundles from Hood Park, but her random-seeming pieces of wood were larger. 

Feeling each other out politically was a bit awkward. At first, she seemed to follow the Current Year trend of liberals being pretty deep in left field. But after I described the original "my political friend" meme to her, and that Elim Odor had reposted it, she moderated. I only agreed with about half of what Elim said, and this meme was in the half I agreed with. I saw myself as navigating a moderate center, in abeyance of wealthy and powerful people who consistently presented US Americans with a horseshoe of 2 political extremes as the only choices. Many of these powerful people donated openly to one party while donating roughly the same amount covertly to the other. 

"Olympia has been the only place around the State where I've felt unsafe - Marathon Park specfically," I confided in her. "A couple of gang wanna-bees wanted a puff from my cannabis vape pen, and wouldn't leave me alone. They followed me to my car and one almost stabbed me with a pen knife. Since he couldn't stab me, he stabbed my tire instead. They were staying in the homeless camp that was situated roughly across the street from the park at the time." The camp had been cleared out about a year after my incident, due to complaints. Reina was shocked and apologized for her home city. 

Reservation systems were one of Reina's banes, and she discussed the difficulty of showing up to a campground, and finding no sites available because they had all been reserved. Her reservations about reservation systems meant she held sites sparingly, only when a campground offered no other option. We compared kits - she had a small American-brand utility van, outfitted with 1 kWh of battery storage, and 14 gallons of water storage in wide flat jugs hidden under the wooden floors. A tiny sink with about a gallon of graywater storage. Her sons had helped her to choose and outfit the van, spending $6,000 to modify the $14,000 vehicle. It was small enough to fit in city traffic and parking spots, and got 25 MPG. 

She told me about being in van-life social media groups, where other women would post about camping in Walton's World parking lots, then getting "The Knock" at 3 am. Walton's World generally didn't allow overnight parking in their lots, and had security people or police inform these guests and help them to move on. I had supported property owners in defending property rights, so I wasn't sure why she told me this, and didn't really react. Personal responsibility had always been important to a well-functioning society. What was the other option, a land of thieves? Two wrongs didn't make a human right - only lawmakers and judges were thusly empowered.

# Oysters, Clams, and Cockswains

I was up early and hungry for oysters. I could go north or south - ports were in both directions. I headed south, and got to Tokeland at about 8 AM. Stopped at the cannibissary, but the sign on the door said that the ATM was broken, and my cartridges weren't out of oil yet. Back in the car. Drove through the town, and parked outside the seafood market by the pier. One of the shopkeepers came out to set up a display, and I asked her when they opened. 

"9 AM," she replied. 

I was impatient; a character flaw. I thanked her and got back in the car. Back north, past the campground, into Westport. Onto the street grid, and park in a paralell spot to search Maps. Found a seafood market. Signal, pull into "traffic" - the street had no cars driving, only parked - around a couple of turns, and park in the diagonal on-street parking, under the Vacuum Packed sign showing the half-dozen ways they can pack your fish. Walked in to find a counter with a dozen large platters of different kinds of seafood. Salmon for $33/lb. Cod for $25/lb. Lobster tails for $18/each. Oysters, the cheapest item in the case, for $14/lb. I ordered 1/2 lb and recieved 7 of the largest oysters I'd ever seen. They went directly into my fridge. 

Before heading back to the campground, I stopped at the observation platform on the northern shore of the peninsula. "Dad, what's that?" a young teen called out, pointing almost directly east. The small family was hanging out on the balcony overlooking the Grays Harbor inlet and Ocean Shores to the north, among a handful of other people. Blue-green seawater surrounded the balcony on 3 sides, splashing against the massive sharp rocks that formed the shoreline below, reinforcement against tidal erosion. "I'm not sure," said a man, without any urgency - sitting on the balcony's only bench, he had one arm around the woman next to him, and they were enjoying the blue sky. The bright pale prominence in question was clearly a mountain, peaking out over a smaller pine-crusted coastal range. But there weren't any rounded peaks like that in Grays Harbor County. The closest snow-covered mountain peaks would the be the Olympics, in Jefferson County. But they were sharp and northward, while this was blunted and eastward, with a scooped section. As a life-long resident of this part of the State, the blunted peak was very familiar to me. It was on every State license plate: Mt. Rainier, over a hundred miles inland. Its 14,410 ft prominence was on the plate because it was visible from almost half of the State, despite the curvature of the Earth. This perspective hid the third prominence to the northeast, Little Tahoma, which was visible from Seattle. The Native name of Ta'Koma meant "taller than Koma" Kulshan, AKA Mt. Baker. It became the namesake of the city of my birth, Tacoma, because the sun appeared to rise out of the mountain from a park inside the city, on every winter solstice. If it wasn't overcast or rainy.

Reina built a large fire each day in the late afternoon. She had bought a ramshackle pile of axe-cut wood, chainsaw-cut wood, ripsaw-cut wood, and circular-cut wood, for $5 she said. But after 3 days, it was running low. I pulled out one of my bundles and donated it to the cause. She told stories of her trips to different places with different female companions - one of whom was terrified to sleep outside of the safety of a locked room, so Reina gave her companion the van and took the tent for herself on the first night. By the last night of their several-day trip, Reina recounted with a grin, her companion had grown brave and asked to sleep in the tent.

"I really like totes," Reina mentioned. I went over how I lived out of them, and had moved down from 24 large totes and 18 small totes when I lived in apartments, to now just having 14 small totes and a cooler. "I used to feel lost in my own 650 square foot apartment," I confided. "I would go from room to room to room, spending 30 minutes or more looking for my wallet or keys." Since moving out of apartments and into the tote system, I haven't have that problem. I was about to make a joke about how all of my kit was from Walton's World - but Reina interrupted me to remark that she used to work in retail merchandising, and had bad experiences with Walton's World's department managers, so refused to shop there. I pivoted the conversation to the 1909 camping book. 

"Oh yeah, hardtack is sold in cracker aisles, top shelf in the corner. Sometimes called rye crisps," she responded to my matzo epiphany. I had had rye crisps, and most were very oily - not at all the tooth-breaking fat-free substance of which I had been reading.

Reina told me that there were going to be a lot of fireworks out over the ocean, both from Westport to the north, and also from Tokeland to the south. I didn't see her much that evening, and so I walked and jogged down the yard-wide trail that connected our loop to the main loop, crossed the street, and passed through the inter-loop trail. The trail was another tree canyon, with thick undergrowth filling in the canyon walls. The far side of the loop had a bathroom & shower building, and a modest amount of water was flowing out from the storage room's door. The storage room also held the building's propane-powered instant hot water heater - probably not much more than a propane burner over a steel section of water pipe, I thought to myseif - why would it be more complex? The coin-operated showers from the 1990s had their coin slots replaced with a button. The shower still ran for 3 minutes, but now it was just a soapy button press to get 3 more, no longer needing to deposit a soapy quarter. As I approached from the east along the through-loop trail, so too did a park ranger approach from the north, in a large truck on the loop's paved road. What timing, to arrive at the same time as another authority figure. Several other guests had gathered in the road, concerned with the water outflow, and flagged down the ranger to unlock the storage room and investigate. A few were confused by my contemporaneous approach, but I cautioned them that I was the wrong authority figure for this situation, and directed them to the ranger, who was wearing a khaki shirt and dark green pants. This side quest wasn't on my quest chain, so I crossed the road like the chicken I was, and continued down the beachward trail. 

Sunset. This concluded a calendar Thursday and a US Federal holiday. Fireworks started, in sparse moderation. Tokeland had hosted more than a dozen fireworks stands, all around the same sandlot at the north end of town, and the amateur pyrotechnics engineers were playing out these purchases slowly. I stood on the dunes, wishing that I had brought my rope throne. 

"I want to see the sunset," said an older woman to a young woman, walking through the sand dunes. They looked similar, like a matriarch and her adult daughter. A couple of kids dashed around the dunes ahead of them, heralding the family's arrival. "Did you see the sunset?" Asked the older woman to me. I had, I apologized to her. It was a common sunset, not even having a significant green flash. The familly continued to the shore, followed by a younger man and another child. Then other families, coming out to see the fireworks. After an hour or so, I had seen my fill of "hiss-boom-ahh", and went back to my tent and bed. Since I "became old" in 2018 and started going to bed at around 8 PM, it had become difficult to stay up past sunset for events like this. I lived on Standard Time, saving daylight all year, so this might have been 9 PM to everyone around me. It was how I slept so well, and this made me too sweet for some. 

# Fear Of Missing Out? You Aren't Gonna Need It.

Waking up with ringing ears, a park ranger later said that the group had gotten out of hand late that night. Oh well. I had said NoMo to FOMO some years ago, because YAGNI. Reina later said that she had a long Zoom call with her sons that night, so just stayed in her van. 

"Something that I like about camping in Oregon," Reina said in the afternoon, "is the propane canister recycling in every campground. Along with regular recycling." I didn't ask her who paid to have the regular recycling hauled away. Some cities in this State collected for free, some charged a collection fee, and some just didn't offer recycling - if you wanted to recycle in those municipalities, you have to haul it to the transfer station yourself. As a business, recycling only made financial sense within a certain radius of a reprocessing facility for that type of recyclable. Beyond this radius, the gasoline or diesel fuel could cost more than the recyclable would pay, and the business turned into a charity. Each recycling business had a different mix of products which they could recycle - AKA had a buyer for that specific raw material. No idea how The Left came to be in the pocket of Big Recycling. Or Big Solar, or Big Virtue in general. It felt like some Authoritarians got lost in Left Field while looking for the One Thing That Nobody Could Disobey. I silently assumed Oregon State Parks paid for the Household Hazardous Waste disposal and agreed that would be helpful. As she refilled her wine glass, she told me that her sons refilled her propane canisters from a tank. While researching earlier, I had found social media comments saying that refilling these canisters broke a Federal law, but didn't bring it up. 

"I've always liked that riff show - you know, the guy and 2 robots...err professional comedy professionals...who make jokes during movies," I told Reina, trying to find a cultural touchstone. It was a 2-hour show, and from 1994 to 1999 was on cable TV during the day, so most of the Boomer Generation became aware of it in some capacity. "My youngest son is into that," she replied. The fandom wasn't large, with maybe 1 million fans on Earth. While numerous families were drawn together by the show, apparently hers wasn't. Mine wasn't either, and I was also the only fan in my family. 

That afternoong, Reina invited me over and got a large fire going, to use up the last of her firewood. This was her last night there. She was going to Queets or further north, to see where she could camp without reservations. Then she planned to follow WA-20 to the Whidbey Island ferry at Copeland, and east to pass the Cascades, she told me. I was jealous, as I wanted to camp around the Olympic Loop this year, but was pretty certain that the predicted clouds would prevent me from following her. 

She let me barbecue my steak on her grill, which came out nice and tender. I used a paring knife since I couldn't find a non-serrated dishwasher safe steak knife in 2022. Then I moved away from dishwahsers, but hadn't rotated that bit of kit. The paring knife needed sharpening from time to time, and I slid the blade against the flat metal handle of my BBQ fork. 

"I like using a paring knife," said Reina, clearly still trying to ingratiate herself with me. I didn't say anything, hoping she had thought it worked, and would stop trying so hard. 

Her dinner would be a US Army Meal Ready to Eat (MRE) that she had been saving for no particular occasion. I'd had a few of these in my 20s, and while I was sure that they had much more sodium than I could eat now, I was still excited to see how my tax dollars had changed the successor to Combat Rations (basically hardtack) over the decades. The packaging was almost identical: drab green plastic bags with drab brown letters. "Chicken and noodles. Mashed potatoes. Tortilla. Sunflower butter," Reina called out the different packets inside the larger bag. It seemed to be a random assortment of menu items, like different MREs had been mixed. Shouldn't the tortillas go with a chicken and peppers main dish, rice side dish, and sour cream packet? These MREs weren't quite legal to resell, I pointed out, and wondered aloud if this MRE were a packing mistake, and "accidentally" surplussed because of this. Reina ignored me, reading the instructions. "Knead meal pouch. Insert meal pouch, then water, into heating sleeve. Item might get very hot - lean against another object while cooking. Beware steam burns." After adding the water, she found that this device didn't quite heat as fast as advertised. "It's like cooking a packet with one of those hand-warmers" I realized out loud. She put down her wine glass and produced a frying pan, and put this on the grate over the fire, then found scissors. Carefully extracting the meal pouch from the slowly-heating catalyst bag, Reina cut it open and emptied it into the pan. And then she added the mashed potatoes to the same pan, and started mixing them together. These started to sizzle on the heating pan, and after a bit she had a hot mess. After letting this cool for a bit, she plated the mess before eating. "I wouldn't do that again," she said part-way through. Personally, I wouldn't have mixed them in the first place, but didn't say anything. Looking at the sky, I could tell it was about 5 PM. Which might have been 6 PM to her and everyone else.

"I need to do the evening approvals, any clean-up, daily report, weekly report, and record my hours for the week," I told Reina. 

"Oh, you actually have a job to do," she said with a slight giggle. Leaving my chair, I walked the 40 feet back to my campsite. Up went the hotspot, on went the inverter, out went the TV tray, powered went the laptop. A little more than an hour later, I came back for the rest of the fire and conversation. She used up her last piece of firewood, and I donated the last half of one of my bundles.

# Hitchhiker's Guide To The South Shore

The next morning, Reina packed her few items into her van, and headed out. 

"It's nice being able to just drive away, and not need to fold up a tent," she said over her quiet engine as she rolled past, pointing at my little orange one. More eager to be independent of a mothering figure again than sad to be alone, and weary of her trying to moderate her liberal (and law breaking) tendencies to better match my centrist and personally accountable perspective. "Friends aren't forever - some friendships last just 5 minutes" was one of my personal maxims. If I had someone with whom I could share my grievances, then I'd have a tendency to carry these around with me, to unload on the other person. But if I had nobody to share these with, then my content slots quickly became full of discontent, and I became bored. "Turn off content which is only discontent" was another of my personal maxims. So I agreed and wished her a safe trip. 

The largest metropolitan area west of the I-5 corridor, Aberdeen was large enough to have both a Walton's World and a Pleasantway Foods. And Twin Harbors was the closest part of Grayland to Aberdeen. It was a short 20-minute drive past coastal forests, a correctional facility (don't pick up hitchhikers, say the signs), and oyster fields. Saturday morning, I headed there to refill supplies, and found a package of bright red tuna steaks. I headed back to fry them. Past the oyster fields, correctional facility (no hitchhikers), and coastal forests. Reading a cooking website, it said tuna should cook quickly, so I planned to fry-flip-fry-eat. Tuna onto pan, sizzled and fried like a Scottish person of my ancestry. 

"Crack-Sizzle" came from the green stove. The mess kit frypan was a year old and I'd been using for about 6 months. The frypan's 16 gauge stainless steel bottom bent *ka-crink* almost every time I had used it. And now there was a tiny grease fire underneath the burner. It went out as the grease burned away - did I spill and not notice? Hmm... Flipped the fish. 

"Crack-Sizzle" it went again. Another small grease fire on the stove's drain pan. This was especially dangerous for a propane stove like this green one - if the propane tubing heated up too much, it could ignite the gas inside and explode unpredictably. A tiny hole had just developed in the 18 gauge stainless steel pan - I could see through it when I bent at just the right angle. Sigh. This tuna steak was done, and so was my pan. 

After eating, I headed back to Aberdeen again: past the coastal forests, correctional facility (don't hitchhiker), and oyster fields. Cross the railroad. Park. Into the store, camping section. Find a better folding pan. Self-check. Unpark. Cross the railroad. Back past the oyster fields, correctional facility (just no), and coastal forests, and back to the campsite. Realized the folding pan was covered in warnings - below the PFOA exterior was a toxic alloy of metals. Double sigh. Also, it was known by the State of California to cause cancer, but wasn't everything? Should be fine, I realized, so long as the PFOA exterior remained undamaged. I cooked the other steak and left both pans in the camp trash as I departed the next morning.

# And Covered With Hair

It was time for me to return to my ancestral campground - my family had been camping here for 3 generations, and it was the first place I went camping. On the way through Aberdeen, I swapped my sheets out for a sleeping bag rated to 50 F, and washed it and the rest of my laundry at a lavanderia on the edge of the city. I also found a ceramic non-stick non-folding frying pan. Its ceramic enamel was just like the roasting pans that my mother used to use. The North Shore of Grays Harbor was much gentler than the south shore. Both hosted shellfish farms, but the North Shore's had more awards than the south shore's. While the south shore hosted the correctional facility, a non-profit supported the cats living between Aberdeen and Ocean Shores. But while US-101 connected the south shore to the eastern end of Aberdeen for a 20 minute straight shot at 60 MPH, accessing the North Shore required traveling WA-109 through the rest of Aberdeen, and all of Hoquiam, at 30 MPH. Then another 20 minutes of winding and roller-coaster-ish tree canyon. Then straight and flat tree canyon - except a square mile to the right was logged probably about a decade ago, and the replanted juvenile pines hadn't yet grown tall enough to form canyon walls. This area must not have hosted any Spotted Owls. Before reaching WA-115 and the coast. I'd traveled the route so many times that I had it memorized, despite not having been here for more than half of a decade. Ocean Shores had great beaches for walking and driving, which made them economically useless for shipping. So the North Shore was almost exclusively a tourist magnet. An hour north on WA-109 were Taholah, Qui-nai-elt village, and the Quinault reservation - so Native locals provided business services for North Shore tourists alongside Seattle-based real estate prospectors, like in Muckleshoot or Yakima. Such as the primer gray lawn care pickup truck with a lawnmower in the bed and Quinault Nation plates, that I followed most of the way through Aberdeen and Hoquiam. That driver kept the truck centered oddly to the right side of the lane through the route, before turning right at a side street in western Hoquiam. 

Just like at Twin Harbors, the ground in Ocean City was a thin layer of loam over a sandy field. Dirt was a mixture of oxides (sand) and detritus (cellulose, etc), and this loam likely held more oxides than detritus. Orange tent stakes went in with just hand pressure, no hammer needed. It reminded me of a decade ago, when I decided that tent stakes were pointless for dome tents like this one. And in the relatively-windless Seattle region, they usually weren't. Nearly windless due to the trees, which would grab the air around them, not unlike how they would grab the dirt around them. 

"A bear had been spotted in the area" said a sign. Oh, cool. The loop here had an inner section - go all of the way around, and instead of exiting, you can go back through the middle. Any bear was likely hiding outside of the loop, and so I wasn't too worried. On the map, I had picked a site next to the bathroom building. In reality, a campsite-sized area of undergrowth separated me from it. The bear could have lived in that undergrowth, I kept reminding myself on each nightly trip, and kept the phone flashlight on until I zipped the tent door closed from the inside. 

# To BMC We Must EMC

Morning occurred. I wasn't one of the non-profit's cats, so I got going. I was glad I had the sleeping bag, because I needed it AND the quilt. The 1909 book recommended a hearty breakfast on cold mornings, and I thorougly agreed. "To BMC we must EMC" errored my body, also agreeing. Boiled a lot of water for both coffee and oatmeal, which took extra long: both due to of the extra water, and the cold-and-humid wind. It wasn't the lack of heat, but the high humidity that made cold winds cut to the bone. Unlike plants, a human's thermal relationship with the air around us was predicated primarily through vapor pressure, humidity, and condensation. I pulled strawberries out of my fridge and sliced up a few for the oatmeal. Adding them in, I remembered that strawberries added a lot of water to the oatmeal somehow, and needed more time to boil this away. Not unlike rice, the goal for steel-cut oatmeal was to extract some of the starches into the water solvent, then boil off most of the solvent, so it became a gooey starch porridge. Adding a little milk seemed to help with the gooeyness, and so did patiently boiling off all of this extra water on a very low flame.

Morning bathroom trip. An ancient sonic toothbrush, a pocket-sized USB battery, and a gallon-sized 300 Watt-hour (Wh) portable power device were all plugged in around the sink. "I might have to do something like that," I thought to myself, "were the weather app inaccurate." Another personal maxim was: "Can't trust the clouds" - only weather clouds, as The Cloud was kept secure through System and Organization Control (SOC) audits. I used to email a previous employer's SOC reports to customers - as corporate audit evidence, they're basically confidential. For Customer Eyes Only. This week was mostly supposed to be sunny during the day and cloudy at night, said the app. Heating air decreased relative humidity by increasing the amount of water that the air can store. This was why humidity on the east side sometimes dropped from 65% at night to 15% in the middle of the day. And here it was why the clouds seem to "burn away" - the heated air had much more capacity for water, and so the cloud's water expanded and evaporated into it. And at night, it would get cold enough for the water to condense onto the dirt floating in the air again, but not enough for gravity to overtake the air's hold on the wetted dirt particle. I washed my hands under the charging devices and returned to the campsite. 

What I wasn't expecting was the lack of signal. Again. The website showed this place as having full 4G signal - each signal bar was supposed to be that G of signal quality, meaning the 4 bars I was getting here were supposed to be close to 4G in bandwidth. My campsite had a couple of places where I could get signal, but not reliably. There was a 2 foot by 2 foot spot on top of my picnic table that almost worked, slightly better than at Home Valley, but still not quite John B. Goodenough. This spot would work for checking email and making future reservations, but wouldn't be good enough for the multi-GB downloads needed for validations. I started to get to knew the different towers by their TTL - sometimes getting packets from 106, sometimes 108, and sometimes 241. This TTL metric was originally designed to communicate how many hops (computers and routers) were between the user and the destination, but was more often used for direct identification in the MPLS era. And because it could technically reach 4 towers - 106, 108, 241, and 241 again - my 5G hotspot said it had 4 bars of signal. Even if half of it was through asymmetric routing, where I would send a request to one tower, and get the response from another. I drove around the loop, phone in hand, trying to find a place with signal. The Battle Violets paid no heed, growing happily under their passenger-side awning. The whole loop had almost no signal - a little bit in the front area, some in this corner, oops careful of those teens on bikes going the wrong way. Around to the park's main road, and check the day use area. Day use parking was about a mile from the shore - as close as legally possible. The ocean and about a mile inland counted as a wetland, so couldn't be built upon. Most of the coastal beachland was private property that could not be developed, and most beachgoers were unwittingly trespassing once they exited public beach areas. Driving back east, full signal returned almost immediately upon passing the Camp Host sites and extra vehicle parking lot. 

Days had a rhythm: wake up and make coffee & oatmeal in the frigid low-50s F wind. Relocate the car to the extra car parking lot, where there was both signal, and shade right next to full sun, and do the morning approvals. Back to the campsite for a snack and "be a homebody" for an hour. Maybe just hang out and think about life and nature, or drag out the solar dog and pony again. Lunchtime usually meant strawberres and cheese, or leftover pork chops or steak. Back to the parking area for the afternoon approvals, any meetings, then back to the campsite for dinner and sleep. 

# Off-Grid Exhibition

Overcast morning. "Burn ban - no wood or charcoal fires. Propane OK." said a sign on the bathroom. Checking the phone, it was a calendar Tuesday, and a state-wide burn ban had been imposed. While the coast felt unseasonably cold, the western inland and foothills were seeing a 90+F heat wave, and most of the eastern half of the State were enduring a 100+F red flag heat wave. The reason behind the burn ban was to prevent our skies from becoming red and unbreathable with smoke and ash in the fall, as happened in 2018 and almost annually since. Sleep was challenging because the 50 F (or maybe lower?) nightly temperatures were compounded by the 10 MPH onshore flow that cut oddly through the forest and undergrowth. Only by mixing a "cold weather" 50 F quilt over the "warm weather" 50 F sleeping bag did I manage to sleep, and it wasn't good sleep. Ice in the icebox should have completely melted by now, but the cubed ice seemed to have frozen into one solid block overnight. It made me wish for a burn ban exemption on the coast, but the wish went unanswered. 

Knife coffee error: the knife slipped and a bunch of grounds ended up in the ceramic cup. No worries - I poured the entire contents of the steel cup into the ceramic cup, and dumped the remaining grounds out of the steel cup. Then poured the coffee-and-grounds back into the steel cup, and cleaned any grounds out of the ceramic cup. This removed more than half of the grounds from the mixture, greatly increasing the second try's probability of success. After breakfast, I relocated to the extra vehicle parking lot. Charging the panels seemed like a passive activity, and while it didn't require a lot of effort, it was like driving or watching older children in requiring a small amount of continuous attention. So charging the panels became something that I did during the day - either working during this, or hanging out. Sometimes, I asked myself, "is this reallly my life?" Before starting work, I unglued a cereal box and refolded it inside-out, so it fit around the inside of the hotspot's tote. And I drew "5 G" in 6 inch tall print with a permanent marker on the blank cereal box inside, so it would show through the lid and the bottom - the front and back of the car. So people asking "what's in the box" at least had some clue. Also, it kept the hotspot out of the sun. 

"It's too bad that you can't charge your hybrid battery," said another guest. I was becoming used to running a small off-grid exhibition. 

"The charging math for a hybrid is the exact same as for an RV, but the hybrid has traction batteries instead of house batteries," I explained, "so the energy gets used for driving in a parking lot instead of powering an inverter." Then I agreed - "But yeah, it would be nice not to need a 3rd battery." Non-plugin hybrids had a normal 1 kWh 12 Volt lead acid battery like gas cars, in addition to the single-digit kWh traction battery. While previous year models of my car, and also the higher trim levels for this model year, had an almost 300 lb nickel metal hydride battery under the back seat - my hybrid's trim level had a fuel-saving roughly 20-30 pound lithium battery instead. 

I whistled, to let the birds know that I was happy. Songbirds whistled and tweeted to communicate, and I wanted to join their chorus. The birds didn't seem to mind, as long as I didn't mock their calls. Being cold meant time to swap footwear, so I dug out the shoes from the car's back seat and wore them with socks. The shoes have holes in several places - I paid off my car last winter instead of buying new shoes and clothes - but the BetterYear branded rubber soles were still in great shape. 

For dinner, I added pasta with broccoli and carrots to my dinner menu. Anaheim pepper slices pan-fried with steak - trying to make peppersteak, because I had the spare Anaheim. A small dark bird with red plume started running around the campsite as I sat in front of the stove. This one had a worm hanging out of its beak, just flopping around. I didn't think it was the same bird as I saw in Home Valley, but rather that this kind of aggressive temperament must be common for this species. It might have made a more violent person wish for a foam dart gun.

# Ellliptic Ecliptic

I got paid again, said the paystub email. "It must be a calendar Wednesday," I realized. So after breakfast, I set up the next few stays, almost running out of money again. This was videogame logic, where running out of funds in the moment would yield double benefits in the future. This would happen through being able to stay somewhere without having to pay, since it was prepaid, allowing weeks with no "rent" to pay. 

Solar panels generated the most electricity when pointed directly at the sun. This was easy to do, but quickly became undone, as we're all gravitationally bound to this rotating stage called Earth. Constantly counter-rotating the panel was necessary to keep it facing the sun. Watching the solar panel, I noticed a small sunbeam from the hinge space between the panels. Just as the sun moved from left to right, if you were in the Northern Hemisphere, so too did the small sunbeam always move from right to left. I learned that the sun's travel across the sky - the ecliptic path - kinda had 3 phases: rise, transit, and set. The path was almost vertical during rise and set, and almost horizontal during transit. I developed the system of aiming the panels to the right of the sun's current location, by aiming the sunbeam onto the right panel's left leg. The beam sweeps from this leg to the left panel's right leg. During rise and set, this might take an hour or 2, but during transit it takes only about 30 to 45 minutes, depending on season. Far enough apart to be good work breaks, and sometimes I would sit for nearly an hour, get up and shift the panels, and repeat through the workday. This panel set would probably never leave the Northern Hemisphere, I reasoned, so I drew with permanent marker a couple of arrows onto one of the orange corner protectors: "Sun -->," and below, "<-- Beam." On Earth's Southern Hemisphere, this would have to be reversed. I wrote "Y" on the corner protectors whose legs should be in the sun, and "N" on the ones that should not be in the sun. So I could just glance over at it and see if it needs to be moved. 

The solar panel's built-in kickstands were about the right height for the sun's transit phase, and a couple of slats from a patio table became extra-long kickstands for rise and set. The panels worked best at sunrise and sunset when nearly vertical - if no trees, moutains, or celestial objects occluded the sunlight - but the table slats would do for now. To check if the panel was pointing at the sun, I'd put my head between the panel and the sun - if aimed correctly, my head would fully eclipse the sun's reflection. Were this below my head, longer kickstands would be needed. Likewise, sun above my head suggested shorter kickstands. Left and right matched the sunbeam system. 

Unlike the typical charge-discharge cycle model, my charge and discharge were based around my work. I'd start and end each workday with about 1 bar of battery, and let it charge for about an hour before starting in the morning. The battery was something of a ballast here - a place to store charge for a short while, or keep things balanced, than as a charge-store-discharge system. Sometimes the laptop and hotspot would be drawing 125 Watts during validations, then 25 Watts when mostly idle. Such as when writing software, which mostly consisted of staring at the code on screen while thinking, and occasionally typing quickly. Being able to type 300+ WPM was only really useful when thinking 300+ WPM. Laptop and hotspot would both sit mostly idle, and the panel output would start to charge the battery in addition to feeding their idle draw. After a while, I'd switch back to approvals and validations and slowly discharge the battery, before going back to software or taking a break. Getting 5-6 hours of work done each day, about 500-600 Watts of energy, from a 420 Watt-hour battery was oddly exhilirating. 

At the informal exhibition stand, someone asked if I had a Skylink. I didn't because I wasn't an Elim fanatic, and I got this hotspot when I didn't really have open sky access - 5G works inside apartments and hotels, including those in the breezeway. I'd use the hotel's wifi, except that my job required that I download, install, and delete 5-8 applications weighing in at 3+ GB basically every day, and I didn't want to use up a random hotel's monthly Internet bandwidth.

In the afternoon, I went back to Aberdeen for ice. Aberdeen was much warmer, within the heat wave bubble, and felt amazing after the frigid night. 

# Wooded Wondering Land

By my 4th day there, the critters were familiar with my routine, but confused why I was in their parking lot. Out ventured a rabbit, curious to see why I was sitting so quietly. Realizing it was there, I looked over and said "Hi." It sniffed for a bit, and went back to the bushes. Then a crow hopped out to see what was going on. I said "Hi" to it and it flew up into a tree. Then a large Gartner snake, black with yellow stripes, came out to see. I had caught small ones as a kid, but this was 3 times longer and several times thicker. I said "Hi" to it, and it also retreated into the bushes. Does this qualify me to become a cartoon princess? Human animals were also curious, with more than a few every day stopping by my car to asked what I was doing, to tour my car's trunk, or maybe just drive by while grinning at my ingenuity.

Next Tuesday would be entirely cloudy, and so would Wednesday, said the weather app. So I cancelled my plans to stay at Twin Harbors for the full week, and made reservations in Aberdeen. 

# We Exist Between The Firey Ring And The Daystar

I didn't see the bear. As I struck camp, with a mood of defeat and frustration at not having built enough fire, I pulled the last bundle of firewood out of my car and put into the fireplace in my campsite. The burn ban meant I wasn't going even going to try having another fire - indeed I was somewhat relieved to not need to build another, as I wasn't particularly pyrophillic. "Trying to save money is consistently the most expensive thing I have ever done," was one of my personal maxims, "and much cheaper is exploring different market segments." I shouldn't have tried to save money on the second bundle of firewood. It meant that I wouldn't be baking any corn or potatoes, as the green stove didn't get hot enough for this task. But exploration of space - at least this cleared out a full footwell of car. With firey regret in my heart, I drove to the parking area to do the morning approvals. By the time I had come back from the morning validations to my empty camp - why park at the bathroom building when you can park a little bit away - somebody had swiped the firewood bundle. 

Not knowing where else to go for the weekend, I went back to the same site at Twin Harbors. I was tired and it was nice to just relax. There was a kite flying festival that weekend, and it was an uneventful weekend otherwise. A different long-term guest - 2 cars and no dogs nor tents - had the first site, and a number of surfers using the campground for lodging. Grayland was a premier wave surfing destination, as it featured some of the best waves on the West Coast. The surfers were there to surf, not make friends. I missed Reina's conversation, which made me think that I should focus less on working and more on my own happiness. 

# Don't Let Being Homeless Hold You Back

Grayland and Grays Harbor County could have been named in reference to the almost-perpetual overcast in these areas. They received as much hydrodynamic outflow as the rainforest to the north, but being plains, most of this continued inland. Tokeland could also have been a reference, as the sky looked like puffs of smoke from infinite tokers, just over the horizon. Instead, the places were named for an European explorer and a Native political leader, repsectively. The weekend passed quietly and slowly. I missed Reina's conversation, but not her politics. Watching some riff movies, I thought a lot about where life was taking me, and also thought about kit rotation. Upgrading. Rotation in the logging sense - computer logs, not timber logs. 

The afternoon took me back to Aberdeen. Exchanging my shoes for the flip-flops in my car's back seat, I went into Walton's World for supplies. I wanted a light for my campsite, so I got a small solar-powered sidewalk light for a couple of dollars. Combination axe and wood saw and stake hammer from the camping aisle. Found salt-free butter in the dairy aisle. Checked out and headed out. "Don't let being homeless hold you back!" I shouted to a pair of beggars on East Heron who were perpetuating the homeless stereotype, before crossing US-12 to patronize the cannibissary. The Walton's World wasn't quite next to US-12, along the muddy east bank of the Wishkah, but separated from the highway by a railroad. This meant that - oddly frequently - a person or party might go shopping, and then be stuck for 20 minutes as the mile-long 100+ car train hobbled past at 20 MPH. This didn't happen to me on this shopping trip, but would the next. 

# Totally Hydrodynamic Br0

Today, the sunshine was in liquid form. Living in the Seattle region, rain was so common that it was neither sad nor spontaneous, and instead was merely wet. And anti-offgrid, as the clouds would absorb most of the solar photons that I was planning to convert into electricity. I had been planning to camp around the Olympic Loop, and was on "la push to reach La Push" but weather predictions for off-grid power seemed pessimistic. Arriving into the hotel, it had 2 floors of rooms wrapping around the parking lot. The "least-expensive" $90/night room had a king-sized bed. The suite was so expansive that I could have parked my car inside. Even the king-sized bed felt large, and featured half-a-dozen pillows to snuggle amongst. I fell back into the familar rhythm from Kelso, spending a lot of time in the blocky game. Transfixed by a digital blue sky, in lieu of the real deal. A previous coworker used to have a blue lamp next to his desk, prescribed to stare at from time to time, to treat his Seasonal Affective Disorder. If I were similarly SAD and going to stare at a blue lamp, then I wanted it to have trees and grass and maybe water too. Battle Violets occupied the window through most of the day-night cycle, only having to run from the sun each day between 3 PM and 6 PM. 

# Egg Cakes

For breakfast, I had eggs. My usual way to cook these started with microwaving sausages between approvals, inside a round plastic container, then cooking the eggs in the grease. Cracked one egg and deposit contents into the container, added salt & pepper & paprika, then cracked the other egg. This would wet the dry seasonings on both sides with yolk, so they mixed instead of sticking to the container. Then the lid screwed onto the container, and I shook it like a mixed drink. This pulverized the egg's yolk, albumen, and chalaza into a thick batter. Unlided and microwaved for a couple of minutes, until the mixture wasn't runny on the bottom. Rinsed the egg off the lid while it was cooking. It cooked from the top down, becoming a fluffy egg cake. Eggs were an edible thermoset liquid, where the proteins irreversibly solidified when the water solvent was removed. The proteins inside inflated with steam and carbon dioxide, not unlike a bread roll. And this fluffy cake had to be pulled from the container quickly or it would fall, and become a tiny mountain range of dense egg cake. No sausages this time, so I was making due with just the eggs. Something told me to put a couple snips of green onion into the eggs, followed by a couple of mushroom slices, well-crumbled. It wasn't as satisfying without the sausage, and didn't inflate quite the same, but was okay.

The radio stations here played a lot of uplifting music, to offset the perpetual drear. And moody mornings, full of angry clouds fighting the morning's glory. Like how holiday music was obnoxiously cheery, to help offset the Long Dark, when our planet's orbital mechanics would tilt this State and most of the Northern Hemisphere away from our daystar. Seattle got just 8 hours of sunlight per day in late December every year. And in this region, these 8 hours might have such thick overcast that parking lights wouldn't turn off for days at a time. On some particularly dreary occasions, the overcast in Seattle was so thick that parking lot lights stayed on for most of a week - turning on Saturday night, and not turning off until Thursday morning. Because the light sensor on top didn't receive enough solar photons to switch off the bulb below. Listening to another song, I looked over at my Battle Violets - they were my satellites, at least for now. I wanted a woman to displace them, you know, have a long-term male-female relationship for once in my life. I was still confused from being burned by women in King County. Having a job, apartment, car, and side projects wasn't enough for several. One real estate agent openly berated me for having the gall to approach to her at an upscale bar without first owning 10 properties. And on the other side, a relative's friend recently got bored with married life, and divorced her loving husband of 14 years. Splitting their child and teenager between the homes, and having to sell their forever house that was across the street from the elementary school. I wanted a woman to replace my plants, you know, after I've saved up enough to own 10 properties and to marry and divorce someone. 

A musical celebrity was born here in Aberdeen, and almost every small business in the city incorporated his most famous lyric into their signage in some way. As though every thrift store and mom-and-pop were having Come As You Are parties. As tortured as his life was, his memorial seemed worse - at the end of a dead-end road, with no parking, and neighbors tired of seeing so many visitors and so much graffiti. I visited once, years ago, and promised to never return. Playing this musician's music at any party or bar was a much better way to celebrate his life.

# Steaming Mad At Food

But the week wasn't completely overcast - several days were partly sunny, and I put my folding panel behind my car in my parking spot. I knew I had an upgrade pending, in the form of a more efficient layout. Right now, the battery was sitting inside a tote, and took up another tote of airspace where the wires stood up inside the trunk. And the charger merely clipped onto the terminals, not even being permanently attached. This was great for an exhibition model, but less-than-optimal for long-term operation. And used up 1 more tote of space than it needed. One of the totes in the trunk was sideways and behind the others, with a lot of extra space above - a good spot for the battery to use instead. Were I able to swap the 2 in some way, I could stack another tote on that one, incrementing by 1 the number of totes that could fit.

Oysters were sounding good again, so I looked for them at local grocery stores. Neither the Walton's World nor the Pleasantway had what I was looking for, so I tried again at the HyperValue. Despite being from the North Shore, they tasted just as good as the South Shore's I had prevoiusly. For dinners here, I fell back to my "micro-steam" cooking system that worked in hotel rooms which didn't allow cooking. About as messy as a microwave TV dinner, this system used the same rectangular glass "bowl" - from the right side of the cooler - to keep steam around the microwaved food. This made a high-humidity cooking environment within the microwave, solving the problem of microwaves drying food out because they heated the water, which quickly steamed away. The downside to this system was that it didn't brown nor crisp meats in an appetizing way, so wasn't a perfect solution. It was more like slow cooking and might work better on a lower power level. Also, the plastic lid recommended against microwaving in this way, which was why the lid only lasted a year or so before becoming too cracked to use. But it did result in cooked meats and steamed vegetables, at a fraction of the sodium and cost of restaurant food. I got the idea from fish-and-vegetable steaming bags sold at premium grocery stores - they were paper and plastic bags full of food, and you just put this food-bag into the microwave for 3-5 minutes. Much like the paper steam bag, fish became appetizing more consistently than other meats in this system.

Into the bowl went a couple chunks of pork shoulder, topped with: the sliced half of a shallot, a crushed garlic clove, half of a poblano pepper cut into short strips, and the juice and pulp of half of a lime. Then powdered liberally with cayenne and paprika. One of my cooking philosophies was to use the actual plant for seasoning if it was availalble, and only use seasoning powders like garlic powder if I couldn't get garlic, onion powder if I couldn't get fresh shallots, or lime juice if I couldn't find fresh limes. I liked garlic so I added another clove, crushing it between the paring knife and the tiny cutting board, on top of the room's hulking TV cabinet. This was almost like a version of carnitas, and something about the combination of ingredients created a wonderful flavor. Microwaved on 100% for 5 minutes, because I was hungry and impatient. Took it out and stirred everything around, then microwave for another 5 minutes and it was done. Err...the meat wasn't browned on the outside, but my newer meat thermometer said it was at least 165 F in several places. I thought about making a gravy from the drippings, but there weren't enough, so I just poured these over the meat. Including all of the garlic bits. 

# Ceramic? That's Cheating!

Yelled over one of the 8 bikers staying there the next morning, with a gravelly voice and a grin. "You gotta wake up to the taste of styrofoam. It's part of being on the road!" Bald, with a shock of the salt-and-pepper beard jutting from his chin that was more salt than pepper. Leather jacket covered a white t-shirt and blue jeans. I just laughed while standing in my kitchen, behind my car's open trunk, putting creamer and ice into my coffee. Wearing my usual buttoned short-sleeve shirt and shorts - I tried to dress like a history teacher on a fishing trip. We started talking about being on the road and the solar kit, and he pointed out that my battery was a motorcycle size. He was right - car class was ~1 kWh in capacity, while mine was about 0.42 kWh, enough for turning over a motorcycle-sized engine. 

I had procured the wires and connectors I needed from the Walton's World, and took action that afternoon. It was the perfect time to do the work, because the sky was overcast again. Working on this system when it was sunny and could be charging felt like a waste of sun time. This system used SAE plugs, so I clipped the barrel plug off an SAE-to-barrel plug adapter, leaving the SAE plug with several inches of wire. Then spliced 3 feet of additional wire onto each of the wires coming out of the SAE plug. Matched red with red and black with black. 3 feet of each to match the 3 feet of red and black 2/0 inverter cables. Double-checked the bolt diameter, then put a washer-shaped connector onto each wire's end. Crimped and crimped again. Unbolted the battery, swappd a washer for a washer connector, and rebolted. Then emptied out the half-dozen totes from that side of the trunk and relocated the battery around to behind their previous location. The two large inverter cables required that the battery take a circular path through the air. The Inverter rode on an upside down tote lid like a turtle on a surfboard, and with this change, the "surfboard" could "float" back and forth across tote stacks, by sliding tote lid against tote lid. Charging seemed slightly faster, possibly from the better connection. Another small black wire ran from the inverter's grounding bolt, through the back seat, and around the left rear door's latch shackle. Black because I didn't buy any green wire. It was a little "hacky", but I am a "hack(er)" in the classical sense, and it was the closest piece of bare metal on the car that I could find. 

Looking up from working in my trunk, I saw a VERY familiar black Willys with that custom aluminum rack on the highway. It stopped at the stoplight a block east of the hotel. But this time, it was denuded of water bottles, coolers, panels, wind generator, Instagram sign, and traveling companion. The driver's huge beard sure looked familar. Did he had a falling out with his traveling companion, and she got the Pinstagram account & water bottles? He was heading south on US-101 at about 25 MPH so I didn't exactly get the chance to ask. 

Upgraded from the endless WinHeart bottles, to 5 gallon refillable jugs. I liked the exchange system: if the bottle got weird, I could just give it back to the water bottle company - to rinse or recycle - and get a clean bottle with more water. The manual pump came with a free bottle, and I got another, so I now had 10 gallons of ultraviolet-filtered water capacity behind my driver's seat. Also, my only pair of shorts had ripped, so I got 3 new pair. And a siphon for the ice chest, being two tubes with a coffee-mug sized hand pump between. This made a new chore - decondense (drain) the outer fridge compartment every day or 2.

# Chicken Steam

Other nights, I would micro-steam chicken drumsticks over carrots and broccoli. For a flavor closer to chicken stew, the broccoli could be swapped with celery slices and maybe a red potato, depending on space. Drumsticks had a lot higher fat content, and so had a lot more drippings. These fall onto the vegetables, and combined with the water from the heated vegetables, form a delicious sauce on the bottom of the bowl. As it heats, this sauce boiled around the vegetables, sauteeing them in the drippings as the meat cooks above. A lot of people didn't like to eat their vegetables because the vegetable had been boiled into an unappetizing mess. While grilled cauliflour could be delicious, not everyone was a gourmet chef worth of the Rooftop Club. And a reason that beef stew was so delicious was that the meat traded up flavors and molecules with the vegetables. Tannins and terpenes offered in exchange for gelatin, collagen, cholesterol, and lard - would you accept the trade? A goal with the micro-steaming system was to emulate this in some way, and I've since realized that slower cooking, on a lower power level, allows flavors to transfer more effectively.

Between bites of broccoli, the blocky game continued. And work, on the periphery of the digital blue sky. Plants made their retreat from the window this afternoon as well. I had a portable exercise device, and tried to get 1000 steps each day. 

# Who's Schafer?

I wondered when I made the reservations for my next stay. The car was getting low since leaving Kelso, so I left behind the "harem of pillows" and got gas at a mom-and-pop on the way out. It wasn't about being right or wrong - it was about being a tourist in the State where I was born. 

Being so close to the coast, but staying in a mountain forest, felt odd. As a kid, it seemed like Ocean City and Ocean Shores were the only destinations that existed west of Olympia, but I had since learned that the space between Grays Harbor and the Olympic foothills were somewhat populated. Stopped into Vance Creek County Park to do some approvals. Late morning and the day was already a humid 88 F, with the buttery daystar fully blue-skying overhead. This park had a variety of guests scattered about: Some were there for the nearby body of water on the hot day. A couple of women were sitting at a picnic table on the far side, having a conversation in the full sun. And some weirdoes were hiding their cars in the shade from the trees. I joined the weirdoes and set out my panels. As I was settling into my office's rope throne, a concerned dad ushered his 2 small children past my office without asking questions. Approvals were few, and I wrapped up the reports before 3pm. 

The road to the State Park cut between a series of fallow farms - huge square lawns cut into the mountain forest. A cute house sat somewhere upon each vast green expanse. This region, like much of the State, had joined the Union just before the end of the Industrial Revolution. So the first wave farmed to feed their locality. The US Government was basically giving away land at the time, so long as the recipient could develop the property in some way, and farming was a common development choice. One of the women in my ancestry tried to do this in the 1920s, but wasn't able to sufficently develop the property, and instead wintered in nearby Spokane as the claim reverted to Federal ownership. 

Schafer turned out to be the State's first State Park, and I had accidentally arrived for the anniversary. Straddling the East Fork Satsop River, this area was a company park for the Schafer Logging Company in the 19th Century, where the company would host cookouts and camping for employees, before being donated to the State. In preparation of the anniversary, a new campground loop had been built out. It would be amazing in the 2040s, but for now many of the trees were too juvenile to provide good shade. Most of the old loop, as well as the entire day use area, sat in the Satsop flood plain and flooded almost entirely every year. These areas were only paved with gravel. The new loop was above the flood plain, and featured the common bituminous tarmacadam (AKA asphalt concrete) loop and pads. 

While the coast was unusually cool, the rest of the State had been undergoing a heat wave and today was no different. It was why I was on the coast, but I had had enough of the cold nights and mornings. It was 89 F and uncomfortably hot, so I made sure the Battle Violets had water and the right light, then went down to the river. Finding a nice log, I sat and put my feet into the icy flow. Someone was fishing, or at least the rubber boot clad female had a line in the water. A male helicoptered nearby her, in cotton shorts, t-shirt, and flip-flops. I didn't see any fish large enough to catch. Infantile fish, not much bigger than tadpoles, were hiding in little vortexes just downstream from small rocks. One swam in the vortex creatd by my leg for a few minutes. 

# Centennial Celebration

I didn't have plans for the next day, and the reservation website said the campground was sold out, but it said that yesterday and the FF site next door was never rented. So the next morning, I headed over to the gatehouse to rent it. The station was closed. Hmmm - I decided to try going to Coho Campground on Wynooche Lake and see their FF sites - put into Maps and I was on my way. North along country backroads, going past fallow farms and forest cabins, fun so far...until the single-lane bridge over a river, with a "Private Road" warning - "Gate can close at any time. Road is for large trucks. Keep lights on at all times." I wasn't taking my car through that. And I had no signal up there to reroute, so I just turned around and headed back towards Schafer.

I accidentally drove passed Schafer - almost back to US-12 - to the mom-and-pop in Brady. I was thinking that $40 should cover the site, and didn't know if they could take cards. If they could, it could be a useful backup in the future. My next 2 stays were already paid for, so I was only concerned for the night. 

Back to Schafer. Along the well-maintained 50 MPH uphill backroad, and past the driveway that Maps said was the road. Turned at the actual road that Maps showed as private property, and went a few blocks. Then off the gas to coast up this hill, to reach 35 MPH without using brakes. Car's always-on 20% regenerative brake meant I barely pressed the brake pedal. Kept coasting down to 15 MPH over the small bridge. The gatehouse still wasn't open, and the Open Hours sign wasn't filled out, but the sign mentioned the yellow phone in the old campground's ranger station. Back in the car, around the entrance loop, down the road a block to the other loop, park at the old ranger station without even turning on the engine. I probably should have walked there and got exercise, but I was on a roll. Doing the electric glide. While I was slowly getting out of the car, another camper appeared from out of the bushes and walked across the road. He plugged his kettle into a plug next to the yellow phone. I realized that I was so used to having no hookup that I'd been boiling water with propane, despite having hookups. A waste of good propane, since my electric kettle boiled about 4 times faster than my regular kettle on the green stove. Also, I was starting to stack up a LOT of propane canisters, around the perimeter of my trunk. I didn't know where I'd fit more. 

Opening the yellow case revealed a yellow handset, not unlike the blue handsets from pay phones of yore. Picking up the handset, a phone number automatically dialed. A higher-pitced voice answered - possibly a human woman, but who can be sure in this Modern age? We discussed reserving the site. I couldn't reserve until after 4pm, she told me. Sigh. I thought about going back to the campsite which I hadn't yet checked out from, and to stare at the vibrant blue sky until another plan came to mind. Back past the gatehouse - wait, it was open this time. Let's go get that FF site. The ranger, wearing his uniform polo shirt unbuttoned and not tucked into his khaki shorts, chatted me up - he looked 17 and said that he was excited for the free food trucks. I'd bet he was. I was less excited for the free sodium, but didn't say anything. Looking into the reservation system, he found out that I couldn't reserve the other site because I was still checked into my current site. He checked me out before checking me out and back in, and I paid for the site with my card, keeping the pair of Jacksons as a backup.

The day's burgeoning heat was starting to make me sweat. And the 100th anniversary celebrations were underway. Storytellers, historians, free food, and an auction were scattered across the day use area, and the area's parking lot was full of cars and parking volunteers. Overhead, a small yellow plane buzzed through the wild blue yonder. I told the Battle Violets to grow towards any intruders, and walked down to the day use area. Walking past a table with 3 adults - 1 in period costume - I overheared one of my favorite century-old stories being retold, about Br'er Rabbit tricking someone. I had always identified with Br'er Rabbit, both because of the problems he had, and the cleverness he used to solve them. I was still feeling the heat, so I stayed on the perhiperhy of the events and by the river with my feet in the water - watching several families. Some with small children, some with older teens. One family would leave, and a few minutes later, another would arrive. A mother sat on the shady shore in a folding chair, watching her husband and daughter bond as they walked upriver on the river's slippery rocks, hand in hand for balance. The same yellow plane flew overhead again. "A few days ago, this was all snow," a nearby matriarch told her granddaughter. A group of young teens floated down the ankle-deep river on colorful tubes, before marching back upriver to the starting point. The small yellow plane flew overhead again, on roughly the same route, and someone remarked that the novice pilot was getting a lot of good flight time and experience. A party of older women, and one older guy, emerged from a trail onto the far bank, before continuing down the trail.

The large covered area had what sounded like an auction, and numerous photos of the area from across the past 100 years. I walked past every half hour or so, to get another can of water from my fridge. After the auction, someone brought out an old school tubular TV and VCR on an elementary school TV cart, and played a history video about the campground. The day use area was originally the logging company's only campground loop. The photos didn't show how the logging company dealt with the annual floods, but hookups hadn't yet been invented. Boat trailers for cars had, as had RVs, but the RVs likely didn't plug in yet. It was back when "legalize it" meant alcohol. The light bulb industried had just moved from technological innovation to business innovation, with the December 1924 formation of the Phoebus Cartel to ensure light bulbs didn't last for more than 2000 hours. Or 250 days at 8 hours per day, so about 1 year for a business operating on the then-new 8 hour workday. And Electrification of The West wouldn't start for nearly another decade. The 1909 camping book discussed setting up a fire so that the coals radiated heat towards the tent, and using that to stay warm on cold nights - and to use care, so the hot coals didn't catch the tent - or the forest - on fire while everyone was sleeping. 

# Skokomish Potlatch

The next morning, I struck camp and headed out before it got hot again. Schafer was just out of 5G signal range. While Satsop had great signal, it ended just short of the State Park's boundary. And so the Park offered free Wi-Fi, I learned as I left. 

Highway route would be south to US-12, an hour east to Olympia, then an hour north on US-101. Instead, Maps took me northeast on scenic winding backroads, past farms bordering the southeast Olympic National Forest, arriving at Potlatch in about an hour. A potlatch was a rare banquet - almost like a reverse potluck. A very rich family would have a feast and invite the whole community. Or at least everyone within earshot. Leftovers were sent home with guests. No proof, only a guess, that maybe a potlatch once occurred at or near Potlatch. This campground was on the Skokomish reservation, but this didn't impact the stay in any way. 

Getting into the campground, it had 3 loops - one with hookups and paved roads and pads, one with hookups but unpaved roads, and one with neither hookups nor pavement. My site was in the 3rd loop, which was through the other 2 loops if coming from the main gate. The gatehouse here was a repurposed mobile home, at the northern end of a large parking field, downhill from the 2nd loop. This gave a shortcut to skip the first loop. The 3rd loop was on a steep hilll, with terraced campsites. Most of the sites were open when I reserved, so I took one across the road from the bathroom building on the map. Getting there, I found a mostly-empty loop. The only other guests were a couple staying in an RV trailer across from me. They left before dawn, and returned after dark, with new cases of beer each night. 

"A bear had been spotted in the area" said a sign. I asked the gatehouse, and was told that - a few months ago, they hadn't seen the bear, but they had seen the missing food and bear droppings at a campsite. So kept food hidden, et cetera. I kept my birthday cakes hidden. The fridge kept most of my other food hidden, and must be airtight as part of being an operational refrigeration machine. 

The shorts I bought a size big, so they'd be a bit baggy. I got more than I was expecting, as each day they seemed to grow a size. By day 4 I had to have them up around my belly button, instead of along my hips. I should have bought more clothes instead of wearing the same outfit for multiple days, but *shrug*. A flashback: "They wear them lower and lower," the tuxedo fitter had said to herself decades ago, when I got fitted for Activation - the fraternity's pinning ceremony and dinner. Those tuxedo pants had been cut to be worn around the belly button. I just wanted clothes that didn't fall off in public all of the time. 

# My Shirt Pocket

Another morning. Inner icebox held only water and cans, no actual ice. I needed more ice, water, and I was on my last canister of propane. So I headed to Shelton's Walton's World. Getting these, I took my cart to the self-check, rung myself up, and tragedy - my card was declined. I'd been too zealous about setting up new stays and overspent. Going to the ATM verified: $17 remaining to my name. But lucky me: I still had the $40 from Brady in my shirt pocket. So I asked the self-check attendant to bring my propane canisters back - she had put them into the go-back area, for another clerk to restock. 

"I'm camping at Potlatch, and this is how I'm making my coffee." I told her. She smiled from behind her thick glasses, and let me buy them. 

Much like Ocean City, days here took a familiar shape: wake up at dawn for coffee and oatmeal, then drove down and across the highway to the day use area for the morning approvals, back up for lunch and hangout, back down for more charging and evening approvals, then back up for dinner and sleep. One major difference was that my full-shade site had a few hours of good sun along the road, so I could hang out at the site and recharge from my temporary home. 

While looking across Hood Canal towards Union and Tahuya as the laptop ran validations, I thought "Is this really my life?" Then my project manager pinged me on Teams - was I available? Yes. He called with an idea to get more budget for my role. Despite this being a high-profile role, it wasn't well-funded and thus not full-time - but this could fix that. There was a push to use new-hire funds to hire someone to build out more pieces of this project, but he was confident that if I could show that I was already doing that work, the new-hire budget could be redirected to an existing resource (myself) and the time spent finding another hire could be skipped. I agreed to work on this and started reading the email he forwarded during the call.

A few hours later, I get called by my people manager, who approved my timesheets. He was very excited to hear that I've accepted this work, and had assigned a coworker to teach me how to build these. I was confident that I could figure this out myself, but I was acutely aware of the subtle shift from one manager's "perform this task" to the next manager's "learn this from the coworker" AKA "give the coworker some management experience." And so I gave in and accepted the terms.

That afternoon, I set up reservations for the next couple of weeks. Everywhere was taken on Saturday night. "What about the Tacoma Power campgrounds?" I asked myself. "Wow, they had one campsite available? Kinda pricey at $50/night, but had hookups, and looked pretty close to the bathroom building." 

# Hey, We Have To Breathe That Road!

Cold mornings meant converting my pillow back into a coat. Usually, I would keep the hood over my head and simply rise normally. Oatmeal followed coffee, whistling followed oatmeal, and then a large dust cloud followed a blue sedan which had driven down the steep road. The path had numerous 10 MPH signs and a few speed bumps, but was steep enough that this was difficult to follow. Going downhill required riding the brake, even with my car's 20% regenerative always-on brake. More than once, I found myself inhaling the roadway surface after another driver had passed. Or running uphill back into my campsite terrace.

At night, my nightly routine continued. On each, I paused in the middle of the roadway to admire the stars overhead. 

# Growing Brains

The ice was all gone again, so it was time to head back to Shelton's Walton's World again. Looking at a milk container, it had 5% per serving. Creamer had 1%, but the serving size was much smaller. I realized that milk was the only food that baby cows had to eat, so it had to contain *some* sodium, for the growing brain. I kept buying these packaged birthday cakes, but checking the back of the box revealed that their sodium percentage had gone up from 2% to 4%. Not huge, but an oddity nonetheless. And more mushrooms. They seemed to start going slimy almost immediately, and worse in the cold. I would have to research why. 

A class-B RV pulled in downhill from the first, flying the van-life flag. After setting out an outdoor carpet and folding chairs, the male-female couple spent most of their time in the vehicle. 

# Campsite Cardboard

I was back for lunch. A guy in a black 90s station wagon drove up the loop's dirt road, then slowly back down. Then the camp host drove up the road in an electric maintenance scooter, followed by the same guy-in-wagon. On the way back down, the camp host stopped to ask me if I'd seen this guy before. 

"Yeah, he just drove up and back down. Why?" I asked. 

"Because he couldn't find his campsite." replied the camp host. 

"Oh...and there's no record of his check-in?" 

"Nope." answered the host.

"What did he have there?" 

"Cardboard," the host said, flatly.

"....Oh," I responded, now more confused, I decided to stop asking questions before my confusion became overwhelming. I guessed that my fellow guest was car camping, and had left some fast food chicken or burger containers on a table. And maybe some other camper had cleaned them up or something similar. Just as at Paradise Point, no idea why they stopped at me. Was it because I had a kind face? 

The wasps here were pretty bad, always sniffing around my meals. I used copious (and possibly unhealthy) amounts of bug spray to be able to eat in peace. To set the table, I would first spray the section of table and bench a couple of times, then put down a couple of square cloths. Just like the infinite tote system, I had an infinite cloth system, and had a tote full of these little 12 inch square towels. On top of these would go my plate, and mess kit pot, as it was wide enough to make a pretty good bowl. 

# Can I Block You In?

Mossyrock was on the west end of Riffe Lake, not far from Ike Kinsawa State Park. Another 30 minutes east, Taidnapam was on the east end of Riffe Lake. From Potlatch, it was about an hour south to Olympia to restock the fridge, then about another hour south to US-12. This US Numbered Highway started in the logging capital Aberdeen, passed the Cascades into Yakima, got lost going through Tri-Cities, then exited east to Walla Walla, Lewiston, and became a main highway through Montana.

it was getting into the afternoon and I was worried about work for some reason - probably no reason, but I indulged my anxieties and stopped into Millersylvania State Park to work. Going around the day use loop, I saw one sunny spot, but it was in the middle of the road. Here was another, in an awkward place. A third, tight fit next to a copse of trees and taking up a spot next to the bathrooms. Out went the panel, up went the hotspot, chair and tray, laptop and power, and the office was deployed. My anxieties got some vindication, as there were several pages of approvals. I got going on these - one page down, loaded up the second...

"Can I block you in?" Asked the attractive young woman driving a full-sized pickup, and towing a teardrop trailer. She wore a light gray t-shirt over tight blue jeans. 

"Sure," I said without looking up from my work. I was behind on validations and was worried that someone might say something. 

She walked past me and into the bathroom building. i was on a roll for approvals. A little later, she re-emerged from the building behind me. 

"Looks like you've found a nice sunbeam," she said as she went back to her truck. 

"Thanks," I said, trying to hide my frustration and embarassment - I had been trying to avoid the sun, and she'd accidentally pointed out that I was failing at this. 

Only as she was driving off did I realize that she might have been flirting, and that there wasn't anyone else in that truck. And now I'd never see her again. Sigh - why was I so bad at this? 

Heading to the campground a couple of hours later, a large electric sign along the highway read: "HIGHWAY CLOSED AT," then "MILEPOST 151," and finally, "FOR FIRE DANGER." Oh no! The passes were closing. Suddenly, I was afraid of being "stuck" on the "wrong" side of the State. Such a strange feeling, since I was born on this side, but the other side felt more like home. For one thing, it felt like 90% the west side's population lived in the Seattle region, and most women in that region seemed simply overloaded with male attention. Or didn't like males - which was great for them, but not an incentive for me to stay. While the east side was split between several major and numerous minor metropolitan areas, with hundreds of miles of "open air industrial crop production facilities" - AKA farms - between them. 

From time to time, I thought of my wheel bearing. I didn't know what to think. It was an anomaly that haunted me. I thought back to the snowy winter evening last February, when I lost control and slid down the icy hill when coming around the Tapteal Loop, and my car "bounced" off a snow bank on the right front. Since then, I'd been worrying about the bearing. Since leaving Tri-Cities in April I'd started also worrying about the bearing from driving the rough Columbia Park Trail through Kennewick's Columbia Park every day for about 6 months. Since taking very rough US-97 over Blewitt Pass in May, I'd been even more worried about the bearing. And since getting low gas mileage after leaving Wilbur in June, I'd been especially worried. But in the moment, everything seemed to be rollilng smoothly.

The campground loop was alive with families - packs of young kids on bicycles would roll by, then smaller groups of teens on all kinds of electric scooter. One kid on a skateboard had lassoed another kid on an electric scooter, and sounded like a dad calling at his son to go faster. I looked more closely to see that the "kid" on the skateboard indeed seemed to be in his 40s, after which I was surprised that the lassoed teen was putting up with this kind of treatment from his dad. I was in site number 4, with a full 60-foot pad for my 16-foot car. Orange tent went on a small hill, next to a trail in the back - which lead to another trail, that headed to the toilets - complex to describe but a short way to walk. Some kids had set up hammocks along the trail, behind their parents' RV trailer, to escape the heat on the warm night. 

Again with the signal, The site showed this place as also having full 4G signal. I was able to get good signal from exactly 1 location for about 25 minutes...then the person across the way showed up and parks their RV trailer, blocking my signal. I had to relocate the office over to the boat launch area, where I found just enough signal and sunlight to finish the day. The boat launch itself was closed and depressing. I walked down about 100 feet of 40% incline before stopping at a sheer cliff, overlooking 20 more feet of sharp rocks above the lake shore. Clearly, this boat launch was designed with the assumption that the lake would be much more full. 

Next week would be cloudy again, said a weather app. Monday and Tuesday in Bellingham would have no direct sun. I had a site reserved at nearby Birch Bay, but decided to abort and headed east. Lake Easton looked like a good hop-through location, so I made a reservation there. 

# Getting A Tow

Another small dark bird with a red plume would come out and dance for food. It looked identical to the other 2, despite being dozens of miles away. And it kept looking me in the eye, as though I owed it protection money. "You got a nice tent here. Would be a shame if a bird went above it."

By the evening, the lasso duo had their system worked out and were racing around with the other teens.  I was surprised that the teenager was putting up with this treatment, and chuckled heartily at the sight, but he seemed more enthusiastic than his peers. 

Every campsite in this campground seemed to have hookups, so I had found a double burner at Walton's World and brought it to use instead of propane. I couldn't use this with my inverter, as it took up to 15 Amps and my kit could only produce about 7 Amps. But it should be useful if I stay anywhere else with hookups. Or if I ever upgrade my inverter, and battery, and maybe get another panel, which would take upgrading the regulator... Sigh, it never ends. My pork chops were going to expire the next day, their packaging had said. They were supposed to be my lunches, but I wasn't cooking as much as I thought, and still had all 6 pork chops. So as families raced and rode around the campground loop, I fried pork chop after pork chop in my sturdy new pan. 

# Dead And Gone

Leaving Taidnapam meant going back north to US-12, then West to Morton, and north again along WA-7. Called "Mountain Highway" since I was a kid, WA-7 paved a route from downtown Tacoma directly to the western gates of Mt. Rainier. But I was going the other way: past my childhood home, the church where I learned Taekwondo and Hapkido, my junior high, the Pleasantway where I had my first job, and my first apartment. These places used to feel so far apart, but after living on the other side of the State for so long, they flashed one-after-the-next before my eyes. I stopped into the new WinHeart along the highway for supplies. I grew up a couple of miles from here, through the woods, and sometimes visited this spot long before it was cleared. 

Driving so far south to Taidnapam and back north had my tank low, so I got gas at a dinosaur station further north - inside the city limits of Puyallup. From there, I got back on WA-512, to WA-18, to I-90, and just as I passed Snoqualmie Pass the radio played a song that made me ponder. The old me really was gone, and I was a resident of the east side of the State. I didn't really have anyone that I could call on for emotional support anymore, on either side. Most of my friends in The Beforetime (before 2020) were more liberal than me, and in The Aftertime they found my centrist perspective beyond distasteful. 

Over the pass, missed the rest area off ramp. I didn't need to go anyway. (Yes I did. Sigh.) Easton was only 20 more minutes, said Maps. And then a large sign on the side of the highway said "WATERCRAFT INSPECTIONS" and "EXIT 80 ALL WATERCRAFT" This might have been a safety inspection, but was more likely a cleaning inspection. Don't move milfoil. The State had a variety of areas with almost the same wildlife, separated by a small natural barrier. Such as southern Hood Canal and Puget Sound. Or the Nisqually and Yakima Rivers. And part of having modern transportation technology was using it responsibly and preventing the transport of invasive species. Not unlike keeping rats off container ships. And I wasn't worried. I had a number of devices, such as my air mattress, which might be used as flotation devices in the event of an emergency. But this capability did not qualify them as watercraft, and so I didn't bother stopping. 

Lake Easton State Park was in a mountain forest, nestled between the lake and the highway, along a frontage road. Next door to the park was a private campground and RV park. I headed past there, turned into the State Park, into the gatehouse's driveway, and queued for check-in. The campsites here were northeast of the lake, while the boat launch, hookup sites, and day use area were northwest of the lake. And there were a handful of day use sites inbetween, just off the road. I arrived to blue skies, just starting to turn hazy with wildfire smoke to the south, but vibrant to the north. 

After waiting the hour or so before check-in, I was able to go into my campsite. Went straight from the gatehouse, then turned left. Turning is necessary, as the road straight became a restricted area after this, leading into the Easton Diversion Dam on the Yakima River. Past the vacant camp host site, and a second left, into the second loop. It was a lumpy roller-coaster ride past several empty sites, then suddenly my site. I chose to be right next to the bathroom building, but this campground had numerous trails through the loop, from almost every site to the bathroom. This site was relatively large, and I put the orange tent with its back to a tree. 

# Shady Work

"Wow, this is what passes for full sun around here?" I asked myself. While it was listed as full sun, my campsite had meager sunlight during the early afternoon and that was it. More, Lake Easton was located between high southeast-running ridges to both the northeast and southwest, with I-90 also running southeast between them. This meant the sun didn't rise until about 8 AM. If only I had decided to hop through and not stay for the week. The weather app predicted a bit of rain in the morning, so I rearranged my kit. Extension cord ran from the inverter in the trunk, through into the back seat, where a power strip plugged into it. Laptop & hotspot adapters were plugged into the power strip, and the work laptop cord reached into the front seat. I sat in my driver's seat and started the morning approvals. Only a few pages, not bad... Then the teammate reached out to work on the project, which was assigned back at Potlatch. My manager had reached out to express how important was this work, but confusingly didn't seem concerned about my core job, approvals and validations. So I worked with the coworker for a couple of hours. And kept working on this until I heard the familiar "*beep* ... *beep* ... *beep* ..." from the trunk. The inverter's low voltage alarm meant my electric potency was spent. 

Shifting gears, I watched some riff movies until the light rain let up. 

# ALVIN!

After Monday, days found a similar rhythm as at Ocean City and Potlatch - morning campsite coffee, day use approvals, campsite for lunch, afternoon approvals, campsite dinner. The afternoon came with fewer clouds, and I caught up quickly from yesterday. The rest of the week would be sunny according to the weather apps, but really the sky was fraught with wildfire smoke from near Yakima, and was usually a gradient from pale to blue. Several weather apps apparently only tracked hydrodyamic clouds, and reported a sunny day in their absense, regardless of actual ground and sky conditions. I had made reservations at Yakima Sportsmen State Park, but looking at an air quality app, this area was going back and forth between "Unheahty for sensitive groups" and just "Unhealthy". So I aborted and made other plans to the north. I was still on for Potholes (not Potlatch), as I was inexplicably sure that being so close to Moses Lake would be far enough from the fires that seemed to nearly ring the Columbia Basin.

Chipmunk squirrels were everywhere, showing their adorable cheeks, then scampering up and down trees like any other squirrel. The small dark bird with a red plume showed up again. This time, it seemed more interested in my spilled rice bits than protection money, and we danced around the table as a squirrel watched. 

For ice and food, I headed down I-90 to the Cle Elum Pleasantway. This store had usually seen large volumes of travelers, and was set up to get people in and out. Almost more like a miniature fuel station than a residential grocery store. The water and ice were very conveniently located right next to the exits, so I loaded up and rolled out after paying. 

# Silent Squirrel, Deadly Squirrel

Morning came and went. The sky was hazy with a mix of evaporative, geoengineered, and wildfire smog clouds. The family across the road struck camp while I was making breakfast. But the "Reserved" sign on the site's post stayed up, so they probably bailed early. Maybe the wildfire smog just over the ridge spooked them? Or maybe their toddler got too grumpy? It spooked me too, but I was holding out hope. I got paid again, so I set up the next few stays, almost running out of money again. Pushing the videogame logic to my financial limit, and I was living on rented time. Eventually, this would give a multiplier effect. Eventually. 

The wasps were desperate for pork chops, and one of my lunch bites fell on the ground, so I threw it across the campsite, and watched as nothing happened. Then, hours later, wasp scouts finally found it, and summoned about a dozen sisters to swarm. I watched them between validations. After about 20 minutes, the wasps had their fill and a couple of ants came over and started chewing on it. One lone squirrel tried to take the meat, but got driven off by a wasp, who was slowly failing to keep the ants at bay. About 20 minutes later, the squirrel tried again, and the wasps were too full to fight. It grabbed the cubic-inch of meat in its jaws, locked eyes with me for several seconds, then dashed off into the underbrush before the full wasps could give chase.

# Creamer? I Hardly Know 'Er

Thursday held a new surprise - "Maintenace required soon" said the message on the car's little screen. I needed an oil change and a tire rotation, on top of the dire bearing strait. I needed ice again, and my creamer had gone bad, so I decided to check out the gas station across the overpass. Out and over Lake Eaton Road I went, and found a few establishments spread across West Sparks. The closest was the Seattle region's signature, an espresso stand. This one was cute, looking like a tiny log cabin. At the far end of the frontage road was a hamburger stand, closed until lunch time. And in the middle sat a seashell station. Inside the cramped convenience store, I found half-and-half among the creamers, next to the beers. I wasn't used to seeing this alpine brand, but half-and-half was half-and-half, right? I brought a quart to the clerk. 

"That will be...oh, wait," she said, ringing me up. A taller woman, she looked comfortable in a dark blue sweatshirt inside the inconsistently-lit and inconsistently-weatherstripped building. "It will be $4.45."

I almost balked at the price, but didn't feel like driving all the way to Cle Elum. 

"I'll bet you're glad to see me. It was marked at $8.45 before," she updated.

"Wow, that must be some premium creamer," I replied, trying to play through my sticker shock. 

# Out of the fire path, but landing on the Sun (Lakes).

The week at Easton had left me drained. Not sure why - maybe the elevation? it was about 2200 feet above sea level, about as high up as most of the Columbia Basin and Palouse. But most of the places I'd lived were below 1000 ft. Maybe the constant concern about the sun and wildfire smoke? Car showed "maintenance required" every time I drove now. At least I felt back at home as I came down the foothills and crossed the Columbia at Vantage - stocked with steaks, water, and ice from the Cle Elum Pleasantway. WA-17 northbound was uneventful and depressing, with the normally glorious Columbia Gorge vista partially obscured by wildfire smog. The air was breathable, according to air quality websites, but still felt unnerving to see. When making the reservation, the website had warned of road construction, twice, and again in the confirmation email. But all of the trucks were parked in a lot along the road for the weekend. I made an agreement with myself that as long as I got more than 50 MPG, I wasn't allowed to worry about the wheel bearing. "61.0 MPG" said the car's MPG display when I passed Vantage, helped out by the long downhill from Easton. 

The Channeled Scablands were an amazing expanse, where the Palouse's soft basalt was cut through by the Columbia's immense floodwaters, thousands of years ago. In Old Testament times, according to some, as a west-flowing counterbalance to the east-flowing Biblical floods. Those who see this as "proving the Bible true" forget that "bible" meant "library" and it was like using the encyclopedia's reference volumes in the Research area your local public library to prove that the same encyclopedia's entertainment videos the Fiction area were also true. And they wanted to ignore that the US Congress not only recently confirmed that extraterrestrial life existed, but also that the USA and/or aerospace industry members had 12 small extraterrestrial ships in storage. For me, the better questions were: who melted glaciers in seconds, what tools were used to perform the melting, what did ancient humanity do on the "galactic stage" to warrant this "nuclear" response, and could that group melt our glaciers or worse again? Did ancient Earth have some kind of device (possibly a satellite in orbit) which kept these glaciers frozen, and possibly someone aimed an asteroid at the device? Who warned Noah et al - had someone run a simulation somewhere, to confirm that the sudden glacial evaporation would cause exactly 40 days of rainfall, and not 55 or 63? Or was the angelic warning really some kind of holographic emergency alert system on the satellite? 

Dry Falls State Park was ringed by huge brown sheer basalt cliffs, bare rock exposed to atmosphere. Layers of 50+ foot tall basalt flows were visible from within the coulee - a Native word for these "ancient mega-riverbed ruts that cut across the rolling landscape" that didn't have a direct translation. Some areas seem to have 8 or 9 layers of basalt. Just down a bit, the basalt cliffs had worn away into enormous basalt rock and gravel piles, hundreds of feet tall. "ROCKS" said the occasional road sign, as a reminder to be careful in case one or several of these 10 lb to 100 lb cubic or hexagonal stones were to fall into your car's lane. 

The campground was just one part of this State Park. Like most, it had a day use area across the state highway, and like some it had a trail system behind the campground. Trails ringed the perimeter and crossed the interior of the former falls' flat floor. Campsites were dirt and gravel expanses with a table and fire pit each - not really any grass or vegetation, beyond the occasional tree providing shade. Normally I wouldn't have enjoyed this, but the lack of plant life meant a lack of humidity. Also, the smoke in the sky took the edge off of the sun's rays, just like any cloud. Reaching into my trunk in the red afternoon, I turned on the broken meat thermometer, and it said "108 F". Oh, expletive deleted. A red American-brand pickup truck drove past, with a middle-aged man in a basketball jersey and 6 kids in the bed. They were driving back from the body of water. This was extremely dangerous, so I hoped that they were using extreme caution while having their fun. Reaching into my fridge to grab an ice-cold can of sparkling water and then sitting in the shade, I was very glad for the lack of humidity, as it enhanced the efficacy of sweating. Last summer, the high humidity in Tacoma made the 93 F heat there unbearable. This was just slightly preferrable. I didn't remember the maximum recommended heat for an AGM battery like this, but I was pretty sure operating at 100+ wasn't ideal. But I left it charging - maybe I shouldn't have?  I finished the evening approvals early, did my reports, and got offline.

The little sidewalk light for my tent didn't get good sun from its location alongside the tent pole, so I started keeping it into the handle of the solar panels. This put all 3 panels together, so when I counter-rotated the other 2, it would also counter-rotate the sidewalk light's 1.5 square inch solar panel. After dusk, that little light of mine shone much more brightly, and it was time to make dinner. Giving my green onions a "haircut" with my scissors, right into the pot of boiling rice, had become a cooking habit. Along with crumbled-up mushrooms, if they weren't slimy. I stopped putting carrots in the rice because they were too sweet for the dish, but kept the broccoli. 

# Dar Largas

The sidewalk light lasted through the night and into the very early morning. I struck camp while my coffee water was boiling, as I did. After a steel cup of cereal for breakfast, I was off to Moses Lake for ice and water. Looking in the rear view mirror, I saw the tell-tale rain streaks beneath a cloud that looked to be over the campground. I had left just in time.

Multilingual places were less likely to give you the runaround, because chances were it wouldn't translate, so I ususally patronized lavanderias instead of laundromats. This one was in Moses Lake. I put a Hamilton into the slot machine and broke even with a pocketful of quarters. Tossed clothes into a medium-sized machine and went outside to get vape-high and kill half an hour. Back in and filled a dryer. I saw a really cute woman in glasses with big round red frames. Pink shirt and jean shorts. Headphones in and nose in a book, very much "don't talk to me" body language. She was drying thick blankets, and I guessed it was for those cold summer nights. I could have helped with that, but I was too shy to break through the headphones-and-book defense.

Almost copy-pasting yesterday, I headed back northeast along WA-17. About twice as far north from Moses Lake as Dry Falls, Steamboat Rock was a giant section of Channeled Scablands where the floodwaters parted. And heading up the scenic byway, it very much looked like a steamboat - large, squared, and surrounded by water. This campground seemed to be meant mostly for RVs and other vehicles with their own toilets, as the only bathroom building was a couple of blocks from almost all of the campsites, and up a modest hill. I tried to be as close as possible to the bathroom, and despite only 1 other site being between me and the building, it was still a hike. 

But at least there was grass, and it felt cooler. Evaporative cooling from the swampy nature of well-watered lawns, a century-old form of air conditioning. I hid from the sun behind a shade grove next to my campsite for most of the day, continuing to use the ancient strategy of drinking a lot of water and sweating most if it out. This heat still drained me. At some point, I got back into the car, turned on the air conditioning, and drove up to the Pleasantway in Grand Coulee for a package of mochi ice cream. Because my icebox couldn't quite freeze foods, I had to eat all 8 all mochi balls that day, before they could melt - oh, what a delicious shame.

Sitting behind the treeline, I wasn't expecting the sudden gust of wind. "Runaway tent!" I yelled, watching my tent tumble toward me. I walked over camly and grabbed it, before hauling it back to my campsite in the baking sun. In went 4 stakes, slowly because of the heat, and then I headed back into the shade. With another can of water as a reward. 

"It didn't have sugar, so it was just water. Why not drink out of the tap?" I could hear either of my parents ask the other with a laughing, mocking tone - desperate to belittle someone else as below them, since the opportunity was so rare for them. But this was more than just water - it was filtered, had carbon dioxide and lemoline added, and was packaged in the attractive and easy to use aluminum can. Just like any other soft drink, but without the diabetes-inducing sugar or a fake-tasting sweetener. 

During my "nightly excursions", I would walk with my phone flashlight on, illuminating my lower half. On the first trip, as I approached the lawn next to the bathroom building, a suprise shape caught my eye - 4-legged and about 4 feet tall. Angling the phone slightly revealed a hint of brown fur - a deer! What a treat - I hadn't seen one since staying in Ocean Shores in 2023, when another of these graceful creatures walked into the hotel courtyard looking for free food, but politely refused the puffy orange snacks offered by a toddler. While the city of Ocean Shores was a wildlife sanctuary peninsula with a huge amount of grass in roadway medians, I wasn't sure how this animal had survived out here. But this one seemed only hungry, and I left it to complete my own pressing task. The night's second excursion brought even more treat, as 3 more had joined the first. One looked partcularly large and hulking - until I walked a little further and the angle changed, revealing a small fawn that kept close to its mother's legs. They shimmered in the mixed moonlight and flashlight, almost like seeing them on a night-vision scope, with each one heads-down in greedy consumption of lawn. 

# Pass With Care

In the morning, it was the normal strike-camp-quickly-and-get-away. Car showed "maintenance required", which the back button dismissed. And like a copy-paste of yesterday, my rear-view mirror held a rain shower over the campground as I headed south on WA-17. It was a humid year, an ephemeral incarnation of climate change, and the weather people blamed La Niña. I'd have to start checking weather apps more, to be sure I wasn't caught in one of these plains white squalls. Southbound on WA-17 towards Moses Lake, traffic slowed to a crawl, and then stopped completely. This wasn't road construction - we'd passed those trucks already, still parked for the weekend. The column of vehicles sat on a slope downhill, with the road going between basalt hills and outcroppings before curving to the right. Eventually, the column started to move again, going around a corner, then around a basalt outcropping. Then past a horrifying scene: a crumpled black German-brand coupe sat mostly off the road, with the nose entirely destroyed and all windows shattered, nobody inside. It was surrounded by a squad of State Patrol and Grant County officers, blocking the oncoming lane. On the opposite shoulder sat a black 20-foot horse trailer, gooseneck sticking into the bed of a gray full-sized American-brand pickup with dualies, emergency indicators blinking. The driver, in a cowboy hat, blue cowboy shirt, blue jeans, and cowboy boots, stood on the road shoulder. He was leaning against the truck hood with his head in his hands. The column continued south past him. I turned on the radio and sang along, trying to put the ghastly scene behind me. Celebrated ephemerality with a retail experience, and back south on WA-17. Watercraft inspections at the weigh station on WA-17 - don't move milfoil. Potholes State Park was directly southwest across the Potholes reservoir from Moses Lake, so I turned off WA-17 at WA-262 and headed west towards Marine View. Spending the day at the State Park's day use area, a vast and shaded grassy expanse, I watched my panels absorb photons. What seemed like an extended family of adults were scattered around the trees on the parking lot side of the grass, in loose groups, with a couple of small children running back and forth between the dozen adults. The group area, across the verdant field, was loud with the noise of more than a dozen children happily playing together, and the occasional parent's scolding. Far on the other side was the boat launch, and a sign next to it warned: "Water levels can change unexpectedly, creating new submerged hazards and surface hazards. Swim and boat at your own risk." This side of the reservoir had acres of new shoreline, where the water had receeded down the gentle slope. Sand eroded out from under the old grassy shore, a couple dozen feet inland now. A line of picnic tables sat a few feet from the old shoreline, and a couple of these at the southern end had been pulled out to a few feet from the new shoreline.

After check-in, I faced the reality of this campground's barren campsites. Reviews said it was rustic and desert-themed, but I wasn't prepared for the nearly-sandlot state of the tent loop. My site had 4 small bushes, and split a tree with the next site in the loop. An irrigation tube jumped from small bush to tree to small bush, creating a visual line of separation between the sites. As though it had been one site, but became split by previous campers during a sit-com episode. I could see almost every site in the loop, over the small separating bushes, and most were empty. The RV loop was entirely different, next to the day use area, with many more trees shading another grassy expanse. Next to this loop's vault toilets sat a water faucet, tap water for dishwashing and maybe drinking. As though the vault toilets could have been some kind of flush toilets, or at least offer running water inside for hand washing, like the Elbe Safety Rest Area. Most people were washing their hands without soap with this faucet, after exiting the vault, which made me glad to have my own drinking water supply. I wanted to express that the prospect of using a vault toilet for a week didn't impact me, but I suspect that - subconsiously at least - it might have been more than my body would put up with at the time. 

Checked one weather app, then another: sunny all day today, some clouds tonight but no rain, then sunny all day tomorrow with a red flag fire risk warning. Great for charging the panels and getting a lot of validations done. Validations required running the program in a VM - a virtual machine, or a computer inside the computer. These used a lot more Watt-hours than approvals, where an application I wrote in 2022 would make a few web requests per approval. And Monday always gave plenty of validations to catch up on, as some of the community members seemed to adhere to the grueling 9/9/6 work schedule. Burgers went on the frypan as the sun went down, and then I went to bed in my little orange tent. As soon as my head hit my coat-pillow, I heard a loud diesel engine, and saw flashing red lights. What in the world was going on? Unzipping the little window in the door revealed an ambulance attending the campsite next to mine. A coyote howled in the distance. The ranger also showed up in a full-sized American-brand pickup, heralding the arrival of an ambulance. A couple of paramedics helped a portly older person onto a stretcher and into the back of the ambulance. The coyote howled again. What the expletive deleted. I took it as an omen, zipped the window closed, and returned to going to sleep.

# Ellensburg Interlude - Peaches. Apples. Cherries.

"Ker-Crack!" roared the sky, waking me. I had a feeling that it was time to go. But first, I had to to...err...go. Thunder lit the cloudy skies. Rolling off the air mattress, I grabbed my hand sanitizer, unzipped the tent door, put feet into flip-flops, and potty-jogged the 20 feet to the vault toilet in just my gym shorts. I could see pretty well in the 3 AM twilight - my night vision enhanced by my light sensitivity issues and light blue irises, and further enhanced by LASIK removing a good chunk of my eye lenses. The eye doctor was an amazing LASIK surgeon a couple of decades ago, and in 2003 turned my 20/400+ eyesight (with severe astigmatism) into 20/15 in one eye and 20/25 with slight astigmatism in the other. Despite growing up with soda bottle glasses, I hadn't needed any glasses for more than 2 decades. Another eye doctor tested me a month after the surgery, and I could somehow combine these into 20/10 from both eyes. The LASIK business quickly expanded, to have locations in 4 major cities: Seattle, Portland, Boise, and Butte. But several years after performing my surgery - around the 2008 real estate bubble and financial crisis, he decided to change careers and become a criminal conspirator. He hired an assassain, and they apparently conspired to murder his LASIK business partner and brother-in-law. The Boron network just had a true crime documentary about him. The doctor proved to be a much better eye surgeon than criminal conspirator, and may still be incarcerated. Could he be in the south shore's correctional facility? (Could he be a hitchhiker?)

"Ker-Crack!" the sky went again, followed by fat raindrops pitter-pattering against the vault toilet roof. Roused from the LASIK flashback, I emerged from the vault toilet with sanitized hands, only to find an unpredicted rainstorm and a suddenly-drenched tent outside. Someone fully dressed and in a coat pushed past me to use the toilet. The rain felt about 75 F and rather warm, but despite this, I panicked and started throwing everything into the car. Propane canister. Green stove. Air mattress. Sleeping bag. Kitchen totes. Except for the tent, which I wasn't sure how to pack wet. Being outdoors in an electrical storm was terrifying and somewhat dangerous, as the tallest tree in the vicinty was only about 3 times my height. I hid in the car and searched Maps for a hotel deal as the occasional lightning bolt lit up the clouds. And what a deal at a certain Kittitas County college town. 

"Dodging Raindrops" was a way of avoiding the worst parts of a storm, and doing things when the rain faded from torrential to merely sprinkling. After about 15 minutes, there was a lull in the rainfall. I hopped out of the car, ripped the rainfly off my tent and threw it into the trunk, spread out across all of the waterproof totes and cooler. This should let it air dry while I drove. Pulled the poles out of the tent and folded them up, into the bag. Stakes, into the bag. Zipped up the bag and tossed into the car. Grabbed tent and stuffed it into the backseat, laid out so the non-tarp sides were on top and could air dry somewhat. The bottom of the tarp was coated in sand and now too were my hands. Sigh, wiped them on my pants, as they should dry soon in this arid land. Restraining my panic through the population center, I was out of the park and carefully heading west again. Any thought of my wheel bearing was left at the campsite - the car still rolled, and that was all that mattered to my panic-stricken mind. I didn't bother with Maps, and just headed west. 20 MPH in the park. Left turn, no traffic this early. 35 MPH past the gas station and through Marine View. Then 60 MPH. What road was this? I didn't care. Stop sign. 60 MPH. Stop sign. 45 MPH. Past a farm. Fresh gravel, 35 MPH recommended. Past a huge modern silo tank. Another farm. Field after fallow field, then orchard after orchard. Peaches. Apples. Cherries. Eventually the fresh gravel ended and 60 MPH returned. Stop sign, fallow field, orchard, stop sign, field with tractor harvesting. After an hour or so, the sky was getting lighter and lighter. I started to calm down - I had driven out of the rainstorm and the clouds, and halfway across Grant County. 

Back on Maps and I was at my favorite rest area - Ryegrass mountain pass, elevation 2,263 ft - within an hour. The sky provided a mix of sunlight and rain, with the post-dawn daystar far enough to the east to still be below the rainclouds above. Too rainy to put the panels out, I told myself, knowing that the 3 bars of battery shown on my inverter would be more than enough. Reusing my Lake Eaton setup of routing an extension cord through the back seat, I sat in the driver's seat and worked on the morning approvals. 

This college town was unique in being on I-90, but not having many large stores or services. The small University was by far the most populous part of the city and probably the largest employer. The afternoon was sunny and pleasantly warm, reaching 93 F according to the broken meat thermometer. It was broken in that the plastic case holding the metal probe had cracked, so the thermocouple could slide out of the probe. Very difficult to use for food, sometimes requiring 2 hands to hold the device together, and another hand to hold the meat as the probe was removed - quite the feat for a solo human. But fine as an atmospheric instrument, and I had another for cooking. 

I went to Olmstead Place Historical State Park, but didn't felt comfortable being alone there. So I checked Maps for another public park, and found West Ellensburg Park. Getting there, I had found the key mix of sunshine, shade, and signal on the eastern edge of the parking lot. Kids played on the rubber-coated steel playground equipment, and I put the car between them and my office, snacking on grapes as I caught up on work. A city work truck parked a couple of spots over, as though the employee were on break. After checking into the hotel that afternoon, I gorged myself on riff movies while letting validations run wild. Ellensburg had a rail station just across the street from hotels, just like Wenatchee. But here, I couldn't feel the train like I did there last April. I took work breaks outside, to use my faithful cannabis vape. During one of these, I pulled out my phone and looked for a campsite at Birch Bay. The east side of the State was still too hot. And jackpot - found several open sites. I picked one that looked ideal. Then I scheduled a tire rotation at a dealership in Bellevue for the return trip. It wouldn't let me add the oil change, but I was sure I could tell them in person and they'd sort it out and perform the work. 

# Free High Sodium Breakfast

Ooh, not sure what to pick - the sausages that were 18%, the waffle that was 28%, or the biscuits and gravy that probably combined to around 33%. Not a commmentary against the hotel, as the shelf lives required by warehouse storage mandated excessive sodium content in the food - it's one of the problems inherent to our modern food industry. I found a packet of apples and cinnamon oatmeal and heated it in the microwave while I looked up the nutrition facts of the other offerings on my phone. The waffle machines reminded me of college, where the cafeterias each had one. The griddle had 2 sides - one made a full-sized waffle, while the other made 4 smaller waffles. I hadn't had one of these waffles since 2021, and seeing the machine made me hungry for another. So I made a bargain with myself, and had just 1 of the smaller waffles. Because 1/4 of 28% was 7%, right? With (salted) butter and syrup, of course. After breakfast, I dug into work. It wasn't only a calendar Tuesday, but a Patch Tuesday, and the repo was awash with corporate approvals and validations. 4 hours of clicking had put the repository into a much better state, and checkout was nigh. After putting everything of mine into any tote in the room, I put a lid on each, stacked them, and moved the Battle Violets and then a half-dozen totes into the car. It was time to go back west. 

Deep in the State's central region, Ellensburg was still some way from the Seattle area. Near the Canadian border, Bellingham was also some way from the Seattle area. More than an hour had brought me back past Easton, and I stopped at the Snoqualmie Pass rest area. This rest area was unique for several reasons, from being one rest area for both directions of travel, to not having its own on-and-off ramps, to sharing the building. I went inside the other half of the building to buy an espresso, but the customer already there must had ordered like 8 coffees or an especially complex pour (perhaps a flat white), and I became impatient while listening to their cat-oriented conversation with the barista. This much frustration and $6 were too high of a price to pay for a pint of coffee, so I left. 

Nestled in the elbow of the I-90 interchange with I-405 was the King County transfer station. I was hopeful that this location could take my empty propane canisters. 

"Just follow the yellow line" said the woman in the weigh house, through the little window. This transfer station had 4 different colors - red, yellow, green, and blue - each leading to a different service. Following the yellow line takes me to the Household Hazardous Waste station. I told the attendants that I had empty propane canisters to get rid of. I pulled all 8 out from around the trunk and put each onto their utility cart. While I was extracting them, the young attendant was picking up each one to feel their weights. 

"These were all empty?" He asked when I was done. 

"Yes," I confirmed, "if they weren't empty, I'd use them until they were." 

"Take them home and throw them in your trash," he told me. This was King County's policy for Household Hazardous Waste, and he thought I was trying to get out of paying for my trash to be hauled away. Sigh. I though about heading back up the hill, and leaving them in Lake Sammamish State Park's dumpsters, but I was too lazy to backtrack. I shouldn't have stopped here in the first place. 

Wheel bearing problem? What's this now? I was getting 63 MPG. One of the great things about hybrids was how the mileage went up in the stop-and-go traffic common across King County's highways. A limited-access lane can carry 60,000 to 80,000 cars per hour, and this area was such a magnet that the population overwhelmed both sets of 8-lane highways on a regular basis, with more than 640,000 cars per hour. Liberals might bring up induced demand at this point, but they would be forgetting that induced demand assumed infinite cars and drivers. Really, it was the Diminishing Returns of supplying more roadway to meet the increasing demands of a constantly-growing population. The population constantly growing was the only way to keep property rates going up, and it was only growing in a few select metropolitan areas - at the expense of rural areas. Especiallly rural areas in other countries, as the USA's population growth had been driven by immigration since the 1970s - and despite recent long lines at our southern border, population growth had been flat for the past decade.

I-405 felt like a very wide tree canyon - wide enough to land a jumbo jet, or Red Ball entire US Army divisions during a Red Dawn. This continued through the interchange where it reconnected with I-5, and north through Everett. This city seemed to be situated along the gentle slope of a large mountain or something, where the other side was a sudden drop-off at the Snoqualmie River. The highway followed this, being a tree canyon up the incline, then suddenly opening up a mile or so of downhill when it passed over the river and sloughs, before turning sharp left to head north again. It was pretty flat there, and the highway increased to 70 MPH. Past the outlet stores and the Tulalip Reservation's casino, through Skagit, then past Burlington's huge farm fields bordering the highway. Stop in at Bow Hill Rest Area, on a hill a few miles north of the town of Bow. Then back onto the highway. Whatcom County line ended the 70 MPH zone and began a curvy mountainous stretch, before emerging into Bellingham. North of the city, the highway increased again to 70 MPH, and then it was time to exit the highway. Around the roundabout, and west for a couple of miles. These were long and straight country backroads - drawn on a map without considering the geography - and went up and down some roller-coaster inclines. The route cut along the southern border of one of the State's 4 gasoline refineries - the only refineries in this corner of the country. This State fueled several other western States, from Montana to Wyoming to Nevada. On the other side of the backroad from the refinery was a massive buffer zone. Signs identified the area as private property of the refinery, but did not forbid trespassing, as it was open to the public during the day - for walking but no motor vehicles, and the one small parking sandlot was bordered with concrete barricades. 

While pushing a cart around the Bellingham WinHeart, I realized how much sodium was in dairy products. Milk had 6% per cup, and half-and-half had 1% per tablespoon. I was suddenly craving bread, but most of loaves had between 7% and 12% per slice. Using 2 slices instead of buns would have meant 14% to 24% per sandwich in bread alone, which was more total than I was allowing myself to eat. Looking for hamburger patties, I eventually found buttery brioche buns with just 6% per bun. A little pricey, but that would do. I loved mayonnaise on my hamburgers, and found that while national brands had 4% or more, the store brand had just 2%. Having cooked Anaheim burgers, I wondered how Canadians would compare them to poutine for staying warm in the frigid winter. Poutine was another curiousity, as US Americans loved fries, gravy, & cheese in any form. And poutine was like a fries hot dish err casserole, which we also loved. Like chili cheese fries, but with easier-to-make brown gravy substituted for the chili. Yet somehow, the combination had never been available down here. It reminded me of visiting the other Vancouver in high school, Surrey for a LAN party during my gap decade, then Richmond (not Richland) during college. I had procured poutine from a hamburger royalty location each time. 

Pulling into Birch Bay about 5 pm, I saw the "Closed" sign in the ranger station window, and the handwritten note to use the yellow phone in Campground B to check in. Great. First step: to find my site, park there, and have a look around. So I drove around Campground A's loop, and found someone in my site. Um, what? Surely there must be some mistake. And as usual, the mistake was all mine. Checking the reservation email, I found that my reservation was somehow made for next week. Sigh. I got a feeling that I made another similar mistake, and checking the oil change, it was also scheduled for next week. I growled in frustration at my handheld data monolith. The Battle Violets grew sympathetically. 

In a gentle panic, I checked the reservation site for FF sites. I found one I thought fit tonight's need, then headed to the yellow phone. 

"The site isn't FF," said the higher-pitced voice on the other end. "but a set of 3 that have to be reserved together." 

"Oh."

"But sites 56 and 65 are open." 

"I'll take numb.." I started to say, looking at 65 on my phone. It was close to the bathroom, all I needed.

"Why didn't you go look at them, then call back?" She cut me off.

"Okay, I will." 

So I parked in 65, called back, and reserved it from an operator with a lower-pitched voice. I only had enough money to reserve for 2 nights. But tomorrow was payday. By the time of the tremendous Tequlia sunset, I had my little orange tent in site 65 and was completing the night's approvals. 

# The Pour Was The Hardest Part

Morning. Chirping overhead. I made knife coffee for the first time. Held knife against cup, so there was only a small gap, and tipped over into ceramic cup. I focused my mind: the butter knife, and the steel cup, were all that mattered. Focused on the knife and the cup. Tilted gently to keep the liquid level as high against the knife as possible, to increase liquid pressure and thus velocity through the small gap. Knife and cup. It was as easy as I thought it would be, and better tasting than the instant blend. I liked my lovers like I liked my coffee - bold, caffeinated, and hot in stainless steel. That afternoon, I kept checking the Birch Bay page, and finding different results. Site 94 was suddenly green with availability. Then red for reserved. Site 113 became green, then red again. What was going on, I asked myself - was one person reserving a site that quickly when someone else canceled? It felt like I were competing against shoe bots for availalble sites. Refreshing again, site 66 was available, and then it was gone - because I'd reserved it. It would require that I pack my tent for an hour and a half, then redeploy it about 40 feet from where it was before, but whatever. 

Stores weren't selling blueberries anymore, and mine ran out. They must have gone out of season. So I thought about packaged oatmeal again and came up with a song from when I was a kid. Magically, I went into to the magical warehouse's produce section to find a nice round and fuzzy peach. Back at the campsite, I cut off a cross-section, about 1/4 of the way through the fuzzy sphere. Just enough to miss the stone inside. Sliced the section into quarter-inch strips, then diced by turning 90 degrees and slicing again, on the small cutting board. These small pieces boiled into the oatmeal porridge very nicely. A large hybrid SUV, longer than my car, warbled past as they boiled. More than half of the vehicles in the loop had BC plates, and a certain smugness pervaded the loop, as affluence struggled against affluence for recognition and dopamine. My own car showed "maintenance required" whenever I drove. That's why the steering wheel had a "back" button, as it was basically a phone with an engine and tires, and I dismissed this message a lot. Reaching out to family members in the area, I set up a small get together at a local park in Bellingham, to trade dopamine and recognition with them. 

I still had the cannabis vaporizer cartridges that I got from a cannabissary in Moses Lake. Each included 1 gram of oil, and I consistenly used 1 gram every 2.3 days or so. I had been buying 3 per week for about a decade from State-licensed cannibissaries. The industry-standard "510 thread" system was very convenient, but if you didn't get high then you didn't know about it. Cartridges were little plastic, metal, or ceramic mouthpieces. Some mouthpiece models were round, and there were a variety of fluted designs too. A few brands had custom mouthpieces, often with their logo laser-cut into the metal base or reservoir window. And one brand used big, chunky painted aluminum knobs as their signature mouthpieces. The basic mouthpiece design had a tiny electric heater coil wrapped around a tiny cotton wick, fed by cannabis oil stored in the mouthpiece's hollow center reservoir. The reservoir was usually clear, to let you see how much oil was left, and had 2 areas - an upper larger area where oil acted like a liquid, and a lower area that was narrow enough for oil to act more capillary. Heating the wick pushed the hydrocarbon above its vaporization temperature, and this ablated the liquid hydrocarbon molecules into the gaseous state & out of the wick. Osmosis and gravity cooperated to pull more oil into the wick. The heater was wired to electrical connections on the mouthpiece's threaded base - the threads were one terminal, and the other terminal was held in the center by a piece of plastic. It was almost like an air freshener that screwed directly into a light bulb outlet, but a little smaller than a single AA battery. This cartridge screwed into the battery component, which was just a lithium battery wrapped in a steel tube or box, with control surfaces (AKA buttons and dials), logic board, and a charging port. Well, really old ones didn't have a charging port, but instead a threaded charger screwed into the cartridge socket, and then the charger and battery plugged into USB-A as a single piece. Newer batteries had a USB-C plug on the side, and my battery could charge from my phone. These would output a variety of low voltages - often from 3.3 Volts to 4.2 Volts - at a low current of probably several hundred milliamps. Building one - or even just disassembling one - covered so many domains of science that it could make a fascinating topic for a high school hackathon, were it not for the device's delinquent purpose. So maybe a college hackathon.

The oil mixtures used in the cartridges had an interesting history. They first appeared just after the State legalized cannabis in 2012, and developed a solid customer base. The process for extracting the oil was pretty simple - the cannabis plant's oil-rich flowers would be ground up, then a solvent would be used to to extract the THC into another container, and the solvent evaporated. Basic chemistry, right? I had helped a friend's friend perform this process exactly 1 time, with butane as the solvent. But the cartridges weren't as good as smoking the plant's raw flowers, and it took several more years of research - enabled by this and other State legalization - to discover the impact of terpenes. These Essential Oils AKA Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) were common to many plants. Pine trees created pinene and citrus plants created lemoline, as natural pesticides. And many varieties of cannabis plant produced one or the other, along with a grab-bag of other terpenes. Having a multiplying effect on THC in the brain, terpenes caused the THC to feel much more potent, while giving mild side effects such as focus (chocolope) or loss of focus (trainwreck). It was one reason that we potheads enjoyed walking in pine forests - these places were overflowing with pinene, and the pinene's uplifting effects multiplied the THC's uplifting effects. These essential oils could be separated with a form of fractional distillation, which was the same technology used to separate crude oils into a variety of fuels and lubricants. And indeed, some cartridges were filled by a laboratory mixture of terpene and THC oils. But the energy industry operated at a few magnitudes larger scale than the cannabis industry. 

Getting cold meant I found my shoes inside the right rear door of my car. They still had the socks from last time I wore them. I put on socks, and shoes, and then felt warmer. To combat the cold, I had picked up some poblano peppers to go into my hamburgers. After putting the patty onto the sizzling-hot frypan, I cut off 1/3 of the large poblano pepper in a triangle, and cut this in half, The top half went into the frypan, and by the time the burger was cooked, so was the pepper. I didn't get cheese, to avoid the extra sodium, and instead put the pepper on top of the patty. The pepper was the best part of pepperjack, I told myself. A slice of tomato went underneath, with a decent dollop of mayonnaise, a guilty pleasure. Anaheim and poblano peppers seemed to be almost interchangeable in recipes. The main difference between them, I learned at some point, was in the skin toughness. Lighter green Anaheims had a softer skin, and don't take as much cooking to soften. This made them better on burgers and in other camp cooking items, and the microwave. Darker green poblano peppers had tougher skins, which held up better in slow cookers, ovens, stews and roasts, and other long extractions. 

# Mol Sauce

In the familiar rhythm of a familiar rhythm, I started the day with the amazing vista of Birch Bay, as the buttery sunrise rose over the coastal forest bordering the bay. Approvals & validations were hitting the battery and off-grid system much harder than usual. I was worried that charging the battery in the excessive Sun Lakes heat had damaged it. Pulling out my light meter, I got 66,000 lux. A trio of eldery men rode by on bicycles. Lux was a measurement of the number of photons in an area, and full sunlight was usually 100,000 lux, or about 3 mols of photons per square meter. My Battle Violets like about 5,000, and I usually used my windshield sun shade as an awning over them. A couple of elderly women rode by on bicycles. What got called "full sunlight" in Birch Bay would count as a 33% haze in Pasco. The solar panel turned about 1.5 mols per second of photons into about 100 Watts of electricity. An elderly male-female couple rode by on bicycles. But here, they were getting closer to 1 mol per second. Lux was weighted around trichromal human vision. The first pair of women rode back the other way, and I smiled at them, trying to seem friendly. Both the Battle Violets' chloroplasts and the solar panel's work function maximized with 500 nm photons, just like our eyesight, so it was still useful for both. I shut the work laptop's lid and spent most of my time looking at the view. The inverter's DC discharge bars stopped being lit, showing that the system was using less electricity with the lid closed. And from time to time, I hibernated the laptop and ran around on the rocky beach like a teen. It was low tide. A small family was playing some distance down the beach. Shellfish were hiding in the sand, but their breathing holes gave them away. "Is this really my life?" I asked myself. 

# Those Who Would Light The Way Must Be Lit

I set up a couple more stays, working backwards from next week. Tomorrow night was the most difficult, as every site seemed taken. A couple of campgrounds along WA-20 had FF sites, but staying at these would require backtracking to cross the passes. There was one green dot - at Deception Pass. On the far side of the map from the only bathroom building. "It's an adventure," I told myself, and reserved it. That afternoon, I returned to the gatehouse to check in again, this time in person with a park ranger - instead of a call center operator. This ranger's blonde hair had been pulled in ponytails that seemed overly juvenile for the rest of her adult body. She was wearing the brown ranger uniform, with long pants. During the check-in process, she asked what I did for a living, and when I started to explain that I was a remote tech worker, and the freedom this granted me, she cut me off to disparage one of the State's billionaires. The Internet had come to life, I mused without saying anything. 

"Which site are you staying in?" She asked, getting down to business.

"Site 66," I replied. It was across the bathroom trail from site 65. 

"Oooo 66 so scary," she tried to joke, but I let the out-of-season joke fall flat. Roman Empire thought of the day: Anyone who studied my History Chart sufficiently (on my website) would know the horrors of life under ancient Rome's Emperor Nero, and how the Gematria cipher was used in the Revelations book of the Bible. "Those who would light the way must be lit," was one of my personal maxims - literally, in Nero's day, which is why people called him The Beast. He wasn't trying to take over retail through hype, like his modern namesake. This person seemed to have minmaxed political awareness to the detriment of education, and I wasn't exactly endeared. What Would Clemens Say? I thanked her as I exited the gatehouse with my receipt and parking pass.

"I've been working on this project at work" one guy at the campsite next door was loudly confiding in his...partner? I couldn't see over there very well in the twilight, but they were sitting across the picnic table from each other, and might have been holding hands across it. A tea candle flickered between them. The two of them had brought their 2 older teen sons for what seemed like a night of male bonding in 2 tents - one for the boys, and another for the men. The two sons semeed to be very good friends and were chasing each other around and through the campsite's underbrush as their dads waxed romantic. Project Guy continued confiding at the top of his voice. Or maybe this was my audio sensory issue flaring up again? I felt like a super spy sometimes. Project Guy went on to describe the entire team structure for a major product sold by my employer. "Each of these used to have its own VP. But then they consolidated to just a few VPs." he continued, before launching into the interactions with his director-level superior in the company. I got the work laptop out again and typed a lot of these details to one of my managers, just in case it came in handy in the future. Then Project Guy started talking about his bad performance reviews & impending suspension, and I lost interest.

# Someone Took Theirs Camping

On my last morning in Birch Bay, the sky was cloudy early, but the weather app said the clouds would wane by late afternoon. This bathroom building consisted of 4 ADA-approved combined toilet and shower units, each with their own external door. As I was about to shower, I noticed a pocket-sized USB battery near the sink power outlet. I was guessing someone stole the adapter to charge their phone elsewhere, but didn't take the battery for some reason. I showered, quickly struck camp, and headed south - lest someone accuse me of stealing an adapter that I didn't need. The inverter in my trunk had a USB outlet next to the standard duplex wall outlet, so I could just plug in there instead. Or, you know, into my car's USB outlet. Going through Bellingham on I-5, I was careful of the semi-truck drivers. Usually, they were the gentlemen of the highway. But up here, many had been aggressive and dominant in a weird way, and more than one had almost run over my small car in the past. Drivers generally travelled more quickly through the mountainous curves than they did 20 years ago - 75 MPH wasn't ucommon in 2024, but 72 MPH was enough to get pulled over back at the end of the 20th Century. Or maybe it was just that highway safety patrols didn't have as much funding in the 2020s as they did 20 years ago, for whatever reason. Just like forest patrols. Drove past the Town of Bow, the hill on which the town of Bow sat, and the Bow Hill Rest Area - after which, the highway increased to 70 MPH again. Exited the highway between Burlington's farms, then west on WA-20 past Fredonia and more farms. Over the Swinomish Channel and through the Reservation, to the campgrounds we went. Past their casino, then past the dinosaur company's refinery. Turned south, went past Lake Campbell and over Deception Pass, and then turned right into the park entrance. 

I hadn't been to Whidbey Island in years, since the time that I was bored at home one Saturday in the spring of 2020, and decided to drive the length of the island. I didn't patronize any establishments at the time, as it was a season for not embracing, and instead I merely enjoyed the highway scenery from Anacortes to Clinton and back. This time was different than I remembered, which was probably an artifact of my jaded past outlook. Naval Air Station Whidbey Island was further south - just north of Oak Harbor, said road signs. The bridges over Deception Pass seemed wider and more sturdy than last time. The sky was sunny and beautiful this day, while last time was overcast with light rain. A twenty-something female Park Ranger in uniform sat in an office chair along the park road, about 100 feet past the gatehouse, next to a sign saying "No trailers or RVs longer than 20 feet past this point." I ddin't remember that guard point from the previous visit, and guessed they were serious about that vehicle length restriction. No worries, as my car was only 16 feet long. Driving past her, I continued past the campgrounds and various fishing turn-outs, to find the day use area's large parking lot at the western end of the park. Unfolding my solar panel, I assembled my office behind my car. "View from the office," I posted on social media, with a photo of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and caption: "Apply the Growth Mindset to Remote Work for even more remote work." If any of my contacts were still following me and getting my updates in their feed, surely this would get them to unfollow. 

Mere feet from the crashing ocean waves sat placid Cranberry Lake, a freshwater lake with a big swimming and kayaking area. For those who didn't want to fight the waves, or see their kids be swept away by the rip tide. While Cranberry Lake was mostly ringed by trees, the day use area granted full open sky, along with the view of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Roman Empire thought of the day: Juan, or Apostolos Valerianos, was a Greek refugee of the fall of Constantinople and naval employee of the king of Spain, when he discovered the eponymous strait. This was back when Spain held the Louisiana Purchase and European claim over this part of Earth - Napoleon had to get it from them before selling it to US America, but what he gave Spain for it isn't as frequently discussed. About half of the day use parking lot had been covered by driftwood and a layer of sand. Concrete barricades were arranged around these to partition a rectangle of parking lot, blocking cars from parking among the nearly hundred foot long driftwood pieces. "Don't use driftwood for firewood," said one sign on the corner barricade. "Burn ban in effect," said another.

While staring into the blue with my work laptop open in front of me, a very loud tearing sound roared across the sky, far to the south. It sounded as though the heavens had been torn asunder. Looking south, I didn't see anything at first - then saw a small fighter jet emerge from the treeline about a mile away. Probably from the Naval Air Station. As it gained altitutde, it gained velocity, and very quickly was out over Puget Sound, headed west. And after a moment, the heavens were torn asunder again, as the supersonic shockwave propagated past me. Blue Angels were getting ready to fly away home, having given a show for Seattle's Seafair festival over the previous weekend. The two jets met up and flew around for a bit, before landing. Some time later, the process repeated.

A guy walked over to comment on my setup, as he had a battery and inverter, and was looking into solar to charge them. After giving him the nickel tour of my office and kitchen, I gave him the "safety talk": telling him to look for wire size charts, to be sure he got wires that were large enough. I paused, as the heavens were torn asunder by a third jet joining the first 2. These wire size charts can be found from a quick Internet search, and it was important to get wires large enough that they didn't melt and "fuse" during operation. While 16 gauge were good enough for a single panel's 7 Amps, much larger wires were required for higher currents from multiple panels. But not quite for higher voltages, which was why a 16 gauge cable could carry 12.5 Amps at either 12 Volts or 120 Volts. As I finished, the sky was torn asunder a 4th time. The 4 jets formed into a diamond and began practicing manuevers overhead.

The campground was terraced along a hill, giving each site a good view of the superlative-worthy bay. The loop's only bathroom did look a little far on the map, but I wasn't prepared for the hike - about 1000 ft with 100 ft of vertical elevation. It felt like walking home from the Rooftop Club on 5th & Columbia's top floor, to an apartment I used to have on 8th & Seneca, but only the uphill climb starting at 5th & Seneca. One block (about 330 feet or 100 meters, or a gridiron  football field with only 1 endzone) to the dumpster and potable water faucet. Another, past the site with a Technatruck, to the trail through the middle of the loop. And a third block, up the winding inter-loop trail, to the bathroom building. This was further than Hood Park!

I'd already seen a couple of Elim Odor's new Technatrucks in the wild - one on I-205 in Vancouver, and another on I-5 in Seattle a couple of times. I was sure that these were "ad cars" - where a car company had a professional driver follow a rally course around a metropolitan area, to advertise the new model. Let drivers see it on the road and become envious, since driving meant they're not watching TV or another media featuring the new car's ads. But I was walking mere feet past this one on every bathroom trip. A tent, a patio umbrella, and a portable power box looked lonely in the cavernous bed - the party had packed all of their gear in the other guy's large SUV, which was overflowing with tents, sleeping bags, and coolers. I hadn't been this close to a Technatruck before. It looked like it had not finished loading into the game - as though the owner were playing over dialup, an HPB of yore. In addition to this, it felt oversized - as though the owner had set the model's size to 125% as a joke, before uploading it. Were this this size of a small passenger truck, it would feel realistic. But being the size of a full-sized truck made some of the styling seem silly. One of the reasons I wasn't a huge Elim fan was because in 2019, I was dealing with serious FOMO and buyer's remorse, as my car would never join his fleet of his cyber-taxis. Despite being the only new model on the highways these days, this truck's unusual styling was another. 

In the evening, someone had brought a rice cooker and a wooden chair to the bathroom building, and found an external plug to plug in and cook their rice. Thinking of the pot and stove where I cooked my rice, I chuckled - this was cheating! And it made me wonder how well my off-grid kit would run a rice cooker. 

Each of my "nightly excursions" was a long, uncomfortable, long, hassle, of a long, long slog uphill. Having to hold it the entire way. I kept thinking about getting an RV with an internal toilet on each trip. I didn't really want to buy a toilet that I'd need to clean, but it would be a better living experience in the off season, and more convenient for occasional times like this. Technically, I could get a 5 gallon bucket and spare toilet seat in the back of my car, and "go" there, at least sometimes. But anything short of an enclosed RV cassette or composting toilet was too gross to me, and neither of these would fit in my car.

# It Can't Move While Being Looked At

The night had also muddled the idyllic and sunny afternoon into a frigid and foggy morning. The Strait was like a pipeline from the open ocean, delivering a fresh marine chill directly to Whidbey Island. Despite being sunny all day, yesterday had barely reached 70 F, according to the meat thermometer. I struck camp as water boiled, and made oatmeal & knife coffee. Started the car and saw "maintenance required". Drove past a female Park Ranger with a different body shape than yesterday's Park Ranger, and out of the park. Got gas at a nearby mom-and-pop on the way out. This station was probably selling dinosaur-grade gasoline, since their refinery was the closest. Fuel around here seemed to be about 50 cents cheaper than I was used to seeing. From here, it was about an hour back east along WA-20, then about an hour south on I-5 to Everett, and east again along US-2. The WA-20 Cascades pass had been closed for at least a week, which was why I headed south. Then east at Everett, eventually taking me past Morton and memories of playing tabletop games with friends who lived near there years ago. Occasional "Stay Alert, Stay Alive" signs sit along the highway, and something about the message creeped me out - as though an animatronic, videogame, or paranormal monster might dart across the highway. Or maybe just one with big feet. "It can't move while being looked at," popped into my head, followed by "It chases anyone who looks at it." Then along through Sultan, Startup, & Gold Bar. Stevens Pass took my breath away - literally, as its 4,061 ft elevation was significantly higher than Snoqualmie Pass's 3,022 ft. Snoqualmie had been used for thousands of years, as the pass of choice for those crossing the Cascades north of the Columbia. Both passes hosted premier skiing and snowboarding lodges.

Just over Stevens Pass sat Leavenworth, the sleepy German-themed wintertime tourist magnet. It was a neat little place, full of Bavarian architecture and sandwiches with inch-thick bread slices, even in the summer. The US Numbered and State highway systems allowed each city and town to choose if the highway should go through the town, or next to the town, and if it should have offramps or just intersections. Leavenworth chose pass-through, and the highway came to a relative crawl through the area. Stopped at a red light. I hadn't been here since a bus trip in 2002, organized by my coworkers at the Pleasantway store in Graham. On the right were an array of adorable brown-and-white multi-story buildings around a grassy courtyard, looking like they were taken directly from a book of faerie tales. Three people gathered for a photo in front of one building. And on the left side of the highway were an empty sandlot and a 21st century gas station with modern signage. Eventually, the light turned green, and we continued down into the valley.

Ringed by 3 huge golden grass-covered basalt cliffs, Wenatchee was nestled in the broad Columbia gorge. "Apple capital of the world," proclaimed a sign near the highway. Basalt hills rose on all sides, with the gentler lowland hills covered in housing interspersed with orchards, and the highlands too steep to use. Those to the west were older, according to a local geology professor who made Internet videos, and looked much smoother than the lumpy younger ones to the east. The 20+% inclines shine with golden grasses and sparse trees. On the west side of the State, these hills would be covered in trees, but over here only a few could gather the rainwater that they needed to live. The whole valley filled with apple tree pollen in the spring, and it drove my tree pollen allergy crazy when I visited in April. But this late in the season, these plants were more likely to give off ethylene than pollen, so I found it much more agreeable.

I found  another couple pair of shorts on a clearance rack, and made sure to buy a smaller size this time. 

This metropolitan area was split in half by the Columbia river-lake. On the west sat the old town, south of the Wenatchee River, with the highway just a couple of blocks from railroads. There were numerous hotels in this downtown area, and the rooms were usually spacious. Across the river was East Wenatchee, where the more affluent residents had stratified themselves up the hillside and out of the old city. This campground was in a 3rd part, north of the Wenatchee. The route there was indirect, going down a couple of side streets and behind a fruit warehouse complex. Pallets of bushel boxes created a fort-like wall around one end of the complex, just before the park's small driveway down into the grassy day-use area. The day use area's grassy expanse extended across this park, making possibly a combined square mile of green. My site had full sun, except for the shade from 1 tree, which slowly moved across the parking pad. Shoes went back into the car, next to the water bottles. It was flip-flop weather again. And so every hour, I moved my car forward several feet, returning it to the shade. Not having to start the engine before moving the car was very nice - another reason I got the car. I put my panels out at some point, and started moving them hourly too. The sky was pale and hazy with wildfire smoke, and the remaining sunlight hitting Earth's surface had an excess of red photons, but the panels would still put some small charge into the battery. Maybe only 35 Watts instead of 100, but that was better than 0 Watts.

This park felt somewhat like Maryhill and the ACOE parks, in being a grassy flat plain along the riverside. I heard birds near and far - the near one would chirp, then the far. As though the birds were sitting in the trees, calling at each other. They're such simple creatures - what would they discuss with others so far away? And what about the ones that just beeped, chirping the same tone once per second or so? I wasn't sure, but they weren't whistling copyrighted popular music in the way that I was. Several families across the loop, 2-3 per campsite, with similar allele distributions. Their small kids ran back and forth between sites. Most of the adults seemed stay to 1 or 2 campsites, but a few roamed across several. So maybe this wasn't quite several families so much as several branches of one large extended family. The allele distributions suggested ancestry from a part of Earth which prioritized family above most other concerns. That's cool - camping should be for everyone, not just us homeless individuals. One campsite had a pavilion with a screen house for the 5 adults and 3 children at that site, and it made me jealous. I had seen this kit being sold at Walton's World, and now I wanted one too. 

# The Hammer Is My Gas Pedal

In the morning, I struck camp quickly, before the day's heat became an issue. Wenatchee had both a WinHeart and a Walton's World, so I stocked up on the way out, picking up a new smaller air mattress and separate pump along with comestables. The old air mattress had been sagging for some time, and I'd had to refill it every day since being at Lake Easton. Sometimes a couple of times per night, hoping that I didn't wake up other guests when running its built-in pump at 1:43 AM. I didn't think it had a leak, just a loose valve. The new pump didn't have a battery, but instead pulled 2 Amps at 5 Volts from USB-A like any fast-charging phone. So it could direct-drive an electric motor and attached air pump from a laptop. Or car, or inverter - i tested them all. After deploying the orange tent in the blazing sun, I moved back to the car's shade to unbox these, then took them and my media laptop into the tent to inflate.

These places looked close together on the map. From Wenatchee, it was about 45 minutes north to Chelan and its eponymous lake. Despite being clouded by wildfire smoke, the area still looked amazing. The lake was enormous, and ringed with little vacation houses. And more cute houses around the next bend. It seemed to go on forever, another bend in the road around a bend in the lake, gave another hundred cute little houses terraced up the steep hill. Who the heck owned all of these - it felt like Hilltop or Beacon Hill insofar as the number and size of structure. Another bend, more cute houses. Eventually these give way to a metropolitan area with a street grid and a grocery store. Then it was back on the highway for another hour or so, northeast to Bridgeport. The blue sky and golden hills were hazed by the wildfire smoke. I was about an hour early for check-in, so I went further north to Okanogan to a cannabissary, then on a bit more to Omak. I'd always wanted to visit the area, and this meant I'd been there for about 25 minutes. Bought a Good! candy bar from the Walton's World. Signs for the Omak Stampede told me that I had just missed it by a few hours. Sigh. There would be next year, right? Every year I told myself that I was going to find out about each of these events, and plan a route that visited as many as possible. Well, I might have collected enough "pieces" on this route to assemble that "puzzle" next year - it's a puzzle whose pieces are spread across time and space. (And so might you, gentle reader. Feel free to say "Hi".)

On the way back, I was stopped at a stop sign on WA-155, waiting to turn southbound onto WA-20/US-97. These were basically country backroads, but as State-numbered highways, could be patrolled by WaSPs (State Patrol) as well. Okanogan and Omak had several patrolling WA-215 after the Stampede, but I hadn't seen any since leaving Walton's World. The day was beautiful, with a blazing sun crossing the deep blue sky, and the mix of barren basalt gravel and dormant yellow grasses sloping smoothly up the coulee wall, to almost sheer cliffs where it met the Palouse-y plateau above. Spacious and flat and dry and straight, the easy-mode highways out here posed no challenge, compared to the curvy and cramped and cold and damp highways of the Seattle region. 4 cars flew past at 60 MPH, and I turned into the gap before the next 2 cars at the bridge, about a half-mile away. Their cars looked different somehow, shimmering in the summer heat above the road's mirage, and I considered waiting. Nah. Paint my face blue, let's show them what an unmodified 21st Century family car can do - the the badge inside the door said 4,632 lbs curb weight, and a website said 0-60 MPH in just 6.6 seconds. 

The hammer was my gas pedal, and I put the hammer down. Engine and battery both started dumping energy into my transmission and away I went. "10" said the little screen between the hybrid-tachometer and the speedometer. 25. Shimmer. 40. Closer. 52. Closer. 60. Whoosh! One of them passed me, in his dented matte gray 90s family sedan. 65. Another shimmer. 70. A pair of hooners, I realized, more engine blockheads - going about 85 MPH on the highway. Oh, cool. Pedal and floor still had intimate contact. 75. 80. The other hooner's primer-black 90s fastback couldn't . . . quite . . . pass me. 85. Acceleration curve? Hybrids had an acceleration flat line. 90. I flicked on my turn signal to pass the first hooner. 95. "Why is your car so loud and so slow?" 100. Back in the lane, "just walking away" from the duo. 

Changing lanes back felt like crossing through an unfun portal, and back into a world of personal responsibility. 105. The 4 cars ahead of me were closing fast, only going around half my speed - now was the moment, either I needed to pass them or lose speed *very* fast. Basalt landscape flew past under the royal blue sky. Battle Violet leaves shook violently from the vibrations - fastest plants alive. Battery and fridge didn't enter my mind. "I REALLY shouldn't pass them," I thought to myself. Morally - speed limits and all. What's this about a wheel bearing? 110. Off the accelerator and onto the brake - pressing just enough to fully engage the magnetic regenerative brake, and not the asbestos pads. It was why this 5 year old car still had its original brake pads. 105. Pulling the transmission lever towards me magnetically locked the engine rotation to a ratio of the transmission rotation, causing the engine to roar as it created a 5th gear engine brake. 100. The badge inside the door said 5,432 lbs maximum operating weight - that's a LOT of momentum to convert into other forms of energy - and a website said it couldn't tow because any trailer would overload the regenerative braking system. I pushed the brake pedal a little bit harder, burning a bit of asbestos-on-steel. 95. Still coming in too fast. 92. The last driver in the 4-car line got nervous and started applying their brakes, as I was coming in too fast behind them. 87. My car's red nose hung just 35 feet from their pale rear bumper. 82. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. I downshifted, 4th gear engine brake. 75. WHOOSH! ... WHOOSH! The two hooners finally caught up and passed all 5 of us as one group. 70. Still getting closer - just 25 feet of driven roadway separated tail and nose. Downshifted again, and the engine roared gently. 68. The driver ahead calmed down and their brake lights turned off. Hold steady, 65. 62. I enabled the distance-keeping cruise control and started working the adrenaline out of my system. Slapped the shifter right again, back into "automatic" shifting. Electric drive meant that 1st gear could go 100+ MPH, so why shift? Car salespeople had no idea how to sell hybrids. The engine shut off, and the car propelled itself with its freshly-charged and very full hybrid battery. Switching the display between the dials from speed limit to fuel mileage, it said 42.8 MPG...then 43.1 MPG. I loved this car - going a relatively-pedestrian 60 MPH behind these 4 cars would let mine get back to 50 MPG by the time we reached the campground. 

Hinmatu Yalat-Kekt was remembered for leading the 12 Tribes through the desert and into a promised land. The 12 Confederated Tribes of the Colville Nation, through deserts around the pre-Roosevelt Big River, and into a promised Reservation north of the Columbia. And for this, he was remembered as Chief Joseph, including the overwhelming Chief Joseph Dam. This dam was designed as an L shape, to maximize the amount of river water that could flow through the hydroelectric turbines. So said a large interpretive sign at a viewpoint. I had arrived before check-in and was actively killing time at the interpretive viewpoints. It was a massive dam, with multiple viewpoints and lookouts about 10 minutes east from the highway, and the campground another 25 minutes further east when traveling at 50 MPH. The location was chosen to take advantage of exposed granite bedrock, said the sign - much sturdier for a gravity dam than the softer basalt upper layer. This campground was on the Colville reservation, but this didn't impact the stay in any way. The area felt somewhat unpopulated, as though residents of this reservation weren't especially prolific. Or maybe just enjoyed living in rustic preColumbian lodgings, which is cool - camping should be for everyone, not just us futuristic types. Along the state highway, there were a few farms and a few homes, but the parts of the area visible in the distance seemed entirely undeveloped. Trails, parking lots, bathroom building, and vault toilet buildings were scattered throughout the area. Across the river-lake, orchards and the occasional set of farm buildings covered the sloping gorge wall. The area had some attraction for anglers, so Tribal leaders were generous enough to allow fishing between the dam and the WA-17 bridge a mile or so downriver, said another interpretive viewpoint sign. Fishing rights were the subject of international treaties between the USA and the Confederated Tribes, making them among the most important of Federal laws. A hatchery just downriver from the dam put fish into the river-lake to be caught, trying to replace those that used to migrate up here from the Pacific Ocean. But near the boat launch, I overheared one angler lament to another that all of the best fish from the hatcheries swam west to the Okanogan confluence, then north up the Okanogan river to Canada. To be caught by Canadians.

This reserved campground was on the Colvlle Reservation, and I didn't have any reservations about making this reservation. After check-in, I gave myself the luxury of charging my $100 media laptop. I got it for $100 on Black Friday in 2022. Basically my TV, it was an underpowered dual-core system that could adequately play Internet video, and would last about 10 hours on a full charge. Or enough for about 8 of these riff movies. 4 days, if I watched 1 in the morning and 1 at night. I used to watch these on cable TV as a 7 year old kid, getting out of bed at 2 AM and stealing the remote from my snoring father. I stlll don't know how my childhood self woke at 2am so often. Keep circulating the tapes! Or at least, be one of their Friends. At the campsite, I watched 2 per day to keep my mood elevated. And to help with my Internet video addiction: for the past decade, I had watched 8-14 hours of video every day. Until last Thanksgiving, when I followed up the Turkey Day Riff Marathon with a riff-only binge, which was into its 8th month. I had never been a cord-cutter because I had never paid for a cable TV subscription, only cable Internet for video and games. 

The pavilion was nice to have. It was supposed to be about equal to protection factor 50 sunscreen under direct sun, and under shade it was even better. The shade wall likewise. But there were too many wasps for the screen house, and they got stuck inside instead of being stuck outside. I thought they got in through the top, and tried reversing how it connected, but this just let them in between the bottom and the grass. The accessory might have been better in the spring, or maybe in places with fewer Aculeata. Packed, the pavilion just barely fit in the back seat, with its accessories and a few other items piled nicely on top. 

# Show Me On The Cutting Board Where The Vegetable Gassed You

Morning brought oatmeal and knife coffee, and a familiar rhythm. The campground was basically a bowl about 100 feet above the river-lake, with the boat launch and day use parking on either side, and a road behind connecting them. The front of the bowl was a ridge with walk-in campsites on lawn running to the steep tree-lined cliff, presenting yet another tremendous view, with the cliffside rising above the massive river-lake up to the side of the plateau above. The Columbia had been dammed in several ways by Flood-era glaciers: once at Missoula, again at Grand Coulee, and a third time by Okanogan. The third was why the massive coulee branched south from here. But in contrast with those days, the current river-lake had a white rim, caused by salts left behind when the river water evaporated. As the sole outlet for the entire intra-range region between the Cascades and the Rockies, the Columbia was more saline than most of its tributaries, but less so than the sea. Coming from the world's largest endorheic basin, seawater had way too much sodium for my diet - 1 liter had 14 days worth of sodium. No idea about the river water. 

While frying pork chops, I got hungry for the flavor of carnitas instead of just pork. Carnitas seemed like a set of spices: Anaheim or poblano peppers, garlic cloves, onions, and lime. Or maybe carnitas was a cut of pork? Shallots were one of my secret weapons, substituted for onions to bring out even more flavor. Shallots had an odor so strong that cutting them made me cry. And cayenene & paprika powders, if I didn't forget. Pulling out the little cutting board and paring knife, I sliced a small square out of the pepper and put it into the corner of the frying pan. I carefully crushed the garlic with the paring knife, and sliced it, before tossing it on top of the chop. For the shallot and lime, I pulled out the manual food processor. It was sold as a cheese grater, which it was, and so much more. Lime got sliced into quarters and a quarter was squeezed into the pan before being grated into pulp and liquid over the frying meat. Pulp covered the bottom face of the processor, so I flung this pan-wise. Some recipes said to use rind, but why use rind when nutrient-rich pulp and juice were on hand? For the shallot, I peeled off the outer layer, then grated about 1/2 of the shallot onto the pork chop. After these had pan-fried for a bit, I scraped the toppings off to the side and flipped the pork chop. Had to be careful when frying these sliced toppings, as they cooked very quickly, and would burn in the pan before the meat was done. It was best to plate them after just a minute or three. 

Afternoon brought Blessed Oregon. Yesterday had brought his parents. An elderly woman in a white top and pastel pants, and elderly man in a pink button-down shirt and brown pants, to set up tent and campsite as I was setting up my orange tent. They also set up their own campsite across the loop. Wife and array of daughters arrived earlier in a dark blue SUV, each wearing a different color bright shirt and similar black pants. Yellow, orange, red, pink, green, blue. Like they all shopped at the same store. The afternoon brought the head of the household, driving a gray American-brand pickup with Oregon license plates, and and a pale boat displaying an "OR" registration number in tow. Boats registered in this State had "WN" registration numbers, so this from the south. 

Two burly bald guys and a woman were camping at the site on my other side, the next spot around the one-way loop. A male-female couple with a large truck, and a male third wheel with a boat, from their behavior. Dams north of Tri-Cities didn't have locks, so there were no marninas, and the only sailors around here had portaged their boats on boat trailers - a century-old tradition. The pair of tents suggested no bedroom scenes between the trio. I heard a Cyrillic language from the campsite, and the male of the couple vaguely resembled a certain poloniumogenic world leader. 

# Red Sky In Morning, Sailors Take Warning

The next morning, I started experimenting with heating the coffee while it brewed. Despite the red sky, it was probably going to be a nice day. I put the metal cup over a low propane flame as coffee grounds steeped inside, and the beverage at the end was a lot warmer. Blessed Oregon asked about the panels and setup, so told him about the magical summer I was having, and what I did for a living - working remotely for a package manager, troubleshooting packages when they didn't successfully pass through our automated systems, and filling in the cracks in the system. Sometimes by downloading the software and installing it into a VM. "Oh, you're like a tech fixer," he exclaimed. It was true - "helper" was one ancient form of my last name. I asked about his career, and he said he felt truly blessed as he hadn't had to work since 2020. He started as an auto body repair mechanic nearly 25 years ago, and across 20 years of working he had bought and paid off 2 rental houses in southern Oregon, he told me. Then, in 2020, he quit his auto body job and sold both rental houses, allowing him to pay off his own house and keep quite a few stacks to live off.

While making kinfe coffee, I had a highdea: that my butter knife was like a dam, holding back the coffee grounds, not unlike a miniature Chief Joseph Dam. As with river water, the best coffee was in the middle, and this flowed through the stainless steel spillway and into the ceramic reservoir below. Grounds mostly sunk to the bottom as sediment, but a few rode on the surface, necessitating the knife. And of course, a few grounds got into the cup, but most of those sunk to the bottom as well. Just 2 floated to the surface, and I fished them out with the butter knife. 

I forgot buns when leaving Wenatchee, so got them with ice in the morning. The car still showed "maintenance required" whenever I drove. But I had concern fatigue from the bearing. It reminded me of 2003, the year when I didn't get my 90s sedan's oil changed. I'd get maintenance eventually. Going around the loop for the first time, I saw 5 spots at the end marked "EV" - wow, 5 spots reserved for electric vehicles? Then the "extra vehicle fee" registered in my brain, and I realized that the E here meant "extra", not "electric". This was where someone might park while staying in their 3rd wheel's 5th wheel. 

The grocery store was on the far end of Bridgeport from WA-17. So I turned right and went down WA-173, traveling west through the town for a few blocks, right for 2 blocks, then left to continue west again, and down a hill. Maps said there were 2 stores and a restaurant in the same block, but wasn't very clear about which building was which business. I turned right at the 4-way stop, and parked on the side of the building. Inside was a large tienda, nearly a supermercado, with a slightly wider range of products than the store in Sprague. I walked past the hamburger buns without noticing them, and after touring the store, had to asked the young woman at the checkout counter where they were. Finding the buns, err bollas - "boyas" said the high school Spanish teacher in my head, since 2 LLs made a Y. These were sold by the bread company who were turning our white bread world into nuestro mundo del pan blanco. Turning over the package, I saw 12% sodio per bolla. It was the only brand sold by the store, so I'd just have to deal with double sodium days. Driving back, it was a beautiful morning. The sun sat proudly above the basalt cliffs to the east, in the burgeoning pale-blue sky. WA-17 danced down similar basalt cliffs to the south like a ribbon, before gently curving north and crossing the Columbia. Semi-trucks followed small cars going both ways, so I sat and waited for them. This was where I wanted to be - well, the campsite was, and it wasn't far. I'd be there soon, and the feelilng of not being lost was heavenly. Crossed the river-lake's femto-gorge and turned at the rest area. It had a regulation-size soccer field next to the bathroom building. 

In the evening, the campground host came to visit Blessed Oregon's site. "You're the one whose tent was getting hit by the sprinkers?" Asked the host. The sprinkers were waking Oregon up every night at 11 PM and 3 AM. The host explained that the sprinkler system had 75 zones, and that they had to find the right zone to adjust. Tents weren't very common in the sites with hookups, apparently. 

I knew there were 2 wasp nests near my campsite, because sometimes the wasps scouting my site attacked each other. I watched, leftover pork chop in hand as I evaded wasps, watching. Five of them were sniffing around my cold stove, then wing buzzed against wing as it suddenly became a 2 vs 3 stove match with no referee. Vegas wouldn't give odds. Since they all had basically identical coloration, wasps used pheromones to indicate friend and foe instead of photons. But pheromones didn't have nearly the range that photons had, nor the propagation rate. So these valkyries needed to be within smelling distance before they knew if they were among allies, or competitors from another hive.

That evening brought me an innovation in the form of an anti-apiary device: a tote lid. Wasps were like geese in acting invincible as a psychological part of their tanking strategy. But they had extremly low body mass - not much more than a couple of peas, or half of a grape. And flew about as far when hit with a paddle. While they could dodge and fly around smaller paddles like spatulas, the tote lid was too large for them to avoid. More than a few scouting wasps became too interested in my dinner, and I had to swat them out of the air before they could bring back proof to the hive and recruit others into a swarm. I felt like I was playing ping pong with flying peas.

# Mental Focus And Serenity

Paystub email meant I got paid again. It must have been a calendar Wednesday. After setting up another stay, I still had a decent amount of money in the account, and could have stayed in a motel - that videogame logic was finally starting to kick in. The knife-filtering process was taking a lot longer than it usually did, I realized, and in general was a lot harder to filter than before. An eidetic flashback provided a YouTube video on cowboy coffee: That process was to boiled about a gallon of water, add a few cups of coffee grounds, and let them boiled for a few minutes before taking the kettle off the heat - and sprinkle a bit of cold water into the kettle. The cold water, said the video, cools and sinks the grounds, so the top 3/4 of the pot was liquid coffee. By contrast to cowboy coffee, French press started with the grounds floating on top of the water, insulating the hot water beneath. Steeped for a bit. Then a single stir step loosened the surface tension supporting the grounds, allowing them to sink into the warmer water beneath, to steep a bit longer. My knife coffee modified French press by using a butter knife & the cup angle - and a certain amount of mental focus and serenity - instead of the push-down filter. Heating the cup while it brewed excited the grounds too much, allowing them to float up from the bottom. Some gained positive buoyancy and floated on the surface, while the neutrally buoyant could only float in the middle. My next cup hid under a small towel instead of on the burner, and filtering it was much easier.

Later in the morning, I overheard Blessed Oregon telling his wife that his 12 hour fishing trips were cutting into his sleep, giving him a total of 10 hours for the 3 days. 

Oregon said that my steaks sure smell good. I thanked him and told him that I was jealous of his family's hot dogs. We started talking, and Oregon mentioned that his boat got about 2 MPG and had an 80 gallon tank. That towing someone in an inner tube cut the MPG in half, giving it an 80 mile range. I realized that this was why nearly every campground had a gas station within a mile or 3 - to keep the toys fueled. 

I had a hobby of looking at houses across the river during work breaks. These looked to be about 1-2 miles away. I can see the windows, and in most of them I could make out that there was nobody looking through them - maybe the residents were busy running shoe bots? In the afternoon, a wasp unexpectedly stung Oregon's youngest daughter through her pants. They struck camp in about an hour, sending the 7 women and girls home in the SUV while the man and elderly dad (in a white shirt and pink pants) relocated to the tent across the loop. While the family packed, Oregon asked what I was making - pork chops? I answered yes - and since his family was packing, I was making them all tonight, because tomorrow it would be just me and the bees. At one point, the Cyrilllic trio had moved their chairs about a campsite-length into the center of the loop, to tried and evade the wasps. I tried something similar but had more wasps out there. 

The Cyrillic party's third wheel, from the other side, returned and struck camp. I thought he was with the couple and his boat, but I guessed I was wrong. Earlier, he drove off earlier in his small green Honda, then returned an hour or so later to struck his half of the camp. Maybe he went to Bridgeport for something? 

# My Kind Of Number

Blessed Oregon's tent was across the loop when I started my water boiling, then struck and gone by the time the knife coffee was made. In the afternoon I headed into Bridgeport for ice. The 30 minute drive to the highway was beautiful like usual - with solid blue skies broken only by the daystar, rimmed by landscape of basalt cliffs on all sides, leading down to patchy bushes and continuous golden grass. Having grown up in the Seattle area's beautiful forested Cascade footlands, with roads and highways plowing tree canyons through them, seeing the full open sky was one of my favorite parts of the east side of the State. Beautiful in an entirely different way. Tuesday I had gone all the way through Bridgeport for ice, but this time I stopped at the mom-and-pop near WA-17. Inside, I went looking for a salt-free snack and found myself looking at gummy worms, with 0% per serving. My kind of number. I got these and the ice, and some jo-jo potatoes, and headed back. I liked jo-jos more than fries because the cross-section of potato was so much greater. And my body was telling me that I might have gone just a little overboard with the low sodium diet. Just like when I did the Whole 10 diet program in 2017 with coworkers, and started having low blood sugar problems after 8 days. Between the gummies (a good source of gelatin) and the potatoes, I was feeling more like myself again. In the afternoon, A 1980s RV trailer took the site next to me, where Blessed Oregon had stayed. 

# But I Got To Go Through The Hanford Reach.

Another morning brought another visitor. 

"Can I be extremely rude and run an extension cord across your campsite?" Asked the young mother, walking over from the campsite abandoned by the Cyrillic trio. 

"Sure," I said. My tent was packed and I would be heading up to the day use area soon to do morning approvals. I was happy to let the camp host and next guest deal with the extension cord.

The young mother dragged the cord between the table and tent-gravel, to the RV that had replaced Blessed Oregon, and plugged in. Looking over her campsite, I could see an electric griddle. They were doing exactly what I had realized at Taidnapam, and more power to them for being this clever. This went into the debate of burners or griddle? The answer to that was probably a larger cooking space. The pavilion could have up to 3 attachtents attached, and I could see using one for sleeping, a 2nd for cooking, and a 3rd for an office. Getting a 4th would allow for cutting it up into a vestibule or foyer.

Bridgeport was 3 hours northeast of Yakima. I passed through Moses Lake on the way, getting gas but wasting 2 hours - had I passed through George, I would have been arriving a couple of hours earlier. They looked close together on a map, sigh. After getting gas, I go into the station with munchies in my heart. There **had** to be something in the hot case with low sodium. Maybe a stuffed pepper? This hamburger had 44%, and my arteries get hard just thinking about it. The hotdog over here had an Elim-worthy 69%. That chicken burger was 131% - providing all of my sodium needs through tomorrow night. I wasn't putting myself in the same room as food with triple-digit sodium percentage, so I decided that I wasn't that hungry, and left empty-handed. Fueled up the car. It took 12 gallons, giving about 600 mile range for less than $50. This was a large part of why I got this car - not because less emissions came out, but less fuel went in. A side-effect was that it fit into parking spots, everywhere from Pacific Ocean beach access to Seattle street parking to Wilbur's grocery store to hotel rooms in Richland to RV pads at Taidnapam and Fishhook. 

A road trip was like a 2-hour business meeting between yourself and the road. Sometimes, other drivers would invite themselves too. Like reserving a conference room for yourself, and using the projector to watch dashcam videos. This huge wildlife preserve was named The Reach for the reach of radio transmissions, and traced a huge circle around the Hanford site. Back in the atomic 1930s, preventing radio use was a way of preventing atomic Secrets from exfiltrating. Radios were banned at Hanford and other sites, and the wilderness was patrolled further than any spying tools or long-range radios could Reach. Because any radio that can receive could be rewired to transmit. As a kid, my adolescent father lived here for a couple of years while my grandpa worked - grandpa was a "mess hall fixer" and was transferred from military base to military base up and down the West Coast, whipping their mess halls into shape. Today, accessing the site took a Hanford card, which required a thorough background check and probably more classified government access than could be mustered by a Federal Cannabis Experiment perticipant.

Yakima Sportsmen State Park was next to the Yakama Reservation, but this didn't impact the stay in any way. Most guests seemed closer to my stratification of wealth. A few seemed to be using the "superhero" lifestyle to get by: One of my relatives had the mental age of 13. At one point, she had recruited a team of other adult-aged humans around herself: One had a house where everyone could stay for free. Another had a car, from before their license became suspended. Another still had their license, and could drive the other's car. Another had a bank account. Another had some quantity of money. By combining these powers, they were like one complete adult, ready to take on foes including library fines and lettuce being marked down. As I assembled tent and stove, I could overhear the guest in the site next to mine talk about political matters. I wasn't able to determine this guest's pronouns, but the person was espousing how oppressed diverse people were going to rise up and crush their pale racist oppressers. The Internet had come to life, I mused to myself, again. This guest of indeterminate pronoun was in an ADA site, but didn't seem to have a vehicle. Suddenly I was reminded that my "superhero relative" had a blue State Disabled Parking permit, but couldn't pass a driving test. She wasn't the superhero with the license, nor the one with the car. So the relative got a ride to stores from friends or other relatives, and put the permit placard on their rear-view mirror, letting them park next to the building for her. Why not here too - camping should be for everyone, not just us fully mobile motor vehicle owners. 

In the evening, just after setting up the little orange tent, I got spooked by flashing red lights. Yakima Fire - Brush Unit rolled through in a badass newer red Willys. They stop at the campsite after mine around the loop. While my site had no seclusion from the bathroom, nor the the sites on all other sides, there were several feet of trees and undergrowth between my site and that site. So I had no clue what was going on over there. I went out to the road, near the fire Willys, where I could see around the brush. Two paramedics were talking to a woman who didn't look overly healthy. The site was bare except for the blue minivan in which she was sitting, another white minivan, and a couple of fast food bags on the table. I guessed that she was van camping as part of the van life, and got dehydrated on fast food & soda, or had heat stroke. Hopefully she recovered at the hospital - these can be fatal above 90 F, so staying hydrated was necessary for survival in the summer heat. I snuck back to my site as the park ranger rolled up, followed by an ambulance. 

# Showering Was Usually Too Routine To Mention

On my first morning there, I went for a shower. This bathroom building had 2 large bathroom areas in the front, and 2 individual shower rooms in back. Inside one of the shower rooms, there was a gross black men's no-show sock hanging from the wall next to the shower controls. I used my tote and lid and pulled it off the wall, which squeezed the sock, causing a couple tablespoons of this weird white substance to leak onto both tote and lid. Dropped the sock into the trash, and the primary side quest was complete. This substance was probably just hair conditioner, but still eww. Half of a roll of toilet paper went into to cleaning this off of my tote and lid. Returned to the shower stall - a semi-circle hole in the wall had been holding the sock, and I could see into the storage area. Which meant anyone in the storage room could see me. Great - looking was free, but touching would cost them. Showerhead was dispensing water, so whatever - I lathered, rinsed, and repeated. Despite the light being on, I didn't think anyone was in the storage room when I showered. 

Later, in the bathroom, a guy who looked like he needed a shower struggled to plug both his phone and tablet into the damaged power outlet. Only 1 of the 2 plugs worked, as the other had a dull piece of metal sticking out of it. I felt sorry for him, being unable to simply reach into his car's trunk to plug in. 

By the afternoon, tow trucks had come & gone, and the site next door was reset. Another family parked there and pitched their tents. A campsite was like an open-air hotel, in the way that a farm field was an open-air production floor. And also in covering up what the previous guest might have gone through. Park rangers & campground hosts were not unlike hotel front desk & housekeeping staff in resetting the location - not to disparage anyone, as all 4 careers required a lot of effort and commitment. 

# I Came Prepared

The next day, a piece of metallic tape covered the hole in the shower. After overhearing a park ranger tell another guest about a fentanyl lab in the campground that had been shut down recently, and a park building that was closed because of it, I also forgave the rangers and host somewhat for not cleaning up the pile of fecal matter that was on the sidewalk near the road. I wasn't sure of the animal that had deposited it, and was reminded of the yard after Poncho the dog had gone. One of the toilets had no multi-roll bar to hold toilet paper rolls, and so simply didn't have any.  

"There's no paper in that one," another guest tried to warn me during one trip. 

"I came prepared, " I replied, holding up the roll I had pulled from my car. 

The car had been showing "Maintenace required" for more than 1000 miles, and the dealer in this city would also take 2 weeks before they could see my car. I went to an instant service location instead. Pretty much in and out - so much faster than the roughtly 1.5 hour dealer service. Some of this was that my car maker lost a lawsuit regarding foot mats covering the accerlerator, and so dealers had to check that the mat was locked in place and clear of the accelerator on every service. But the instant service station didn't even want me to get out of the car. 

# The Meriwether Lewis Center for Explorers Who Can’t Read Good and Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too

In the morning, I was headed east early. Both days of my stay at Yakima Sportsmen had been cloudy, so I didn't get to use my laptops much. But today was looking to be sunny and hot. I was going to stop by Richland before heading out to the park. I was headed towards the Lewis and Clark State Park near Dayton, not the Lewis and Clark State Park near Winlock - the Dayton in Columbia County, not the Dayton in Mason County. Why was unique naming so difficult? 

Like clockwork, my car's mileage went down to 48 MPG on some trips, and 45 on others, in and around the Tri-Cities area. In other parts of the State, I could easily get 50 MPG while going 75 MPH, but around Tri-Cities I had trouble getting 50 MPG while going 60 MPH. I thought this was because Richland and West Richland were almost like 7 small towns with a couple of miles of highway and/or highway-rated arterial connecting each, and Kennewick was a set of massive slopes with stop lights at the bottom of most. Also the area was large enough to attract a hooner community. Hooners, AKA engine blockheads, or similar folk. Last winter I stayed at a long-term hotel on Tapteal, and across from there was a rent-a-garage type of place. One of the garages was rented by an engine-blockhead type of group - they were doing burnouts on the road one day, and I had joined the small crowd of hotel guests watching from the parking lot. An ambulance came for the young woman who dropped her motorcycle. She looked responsive on the stretcher, from a distance.

It was nice to be back in a radio market where the Praise music genre had both tempo and harmony, used a variety of chords, and lyrically embraced numerous concepts. I listened to anything and everything on the radio, holding the "next" button on my steering wheel for 3 seconds to "seek" the next station when I reached commercials or boring content. Norteño music was country music when the country was Mexico. Praise music played on the radio in the Seattle market was nauseating, with consistenly glacial tempos, almost exclusively using augmented chords, and symplistically bland lyrics. It felt like the religious music in that market was meant to drive people away from organized religions - not like religious Accelerationism. 

My flip-flops were starting to wear out, and catching the left one on a curb made 1 of the 2 strings come out. Next stop: a retail experience. Using my car, I summoned a Walton's World magical warehouse to appear before me. Going inside, I found a pair of Religious Leader sandals which were marked down. A half-size too small for my 4E width feet, but with the velcro out a little bit they seemed to fit okay. Expending a pittance of money-magic put them onto my feet.

US-12 traced about half of the Lewis and Clark path from Clarkston to Tri-Cities, and then dipped south to reach Walla Walla. WA-124 continued the trail. This campground was along the Touchet ("tooshie" no joke) river, and the Touchet must had had a huge water flood during the basalt flood event, as it sat in a flat mile-wide flood plain between the mountainous sections of basalt Palouse hills and the Blue Mountain foothiils. Some hills stopped quite abruptly, as lava might at the water's edge. While the flood plain was about 500 feet above sea level, hills soared several hundred feet above them, pretty far to the north, and again pretty far to the south. Most of these rolling hills were covered in what looks like the golden leftover stalks from a wheat harvest. The steeper hills, beyond a 30% incline, hosted golden native grasses and were dotted with trees. The steepest were sheer basalt cliffs. Basalt dirt was inherently more fertile than other kinds of dirt, providing more of almost every oxide nutrient except potassium, according to some research. This might contribute to the great fertility of the irrigated Columbia Basin and Palouse regions. Fun fact: The nearby Palouse river was first named Drewyers river when discovered by Lewis and Clark, in honor of George Drouillard. But Meriwether couldn't spell "Drouillard", and could barely misspell it as "Drewyer", said a local interpretive sign. 

Jutting out of the golden grasses and farms like a green beard, this campground was dry and dusty. It felt a lot like the coastal forest campgrounds, with dense brush seclusion between sites. And that brush was all covered in dust, along with all of the maple tree leaves. This might be a swamp in the off-season, but in the moment, it was a tinder box. This was why the State had had a burn ban for almost the entire summer, and most of last summer, and the summer before - why I got worried on the way to Taidnapam, why I got worried at Lake Easton, and why I got worried at Yakima. The last thing I want was for the skies to turn red and unbreathable for a month, again, because some other camp guest lost control of their campfire. There was less concern for this in previous decades and centuries, when forest maintenance was taken seriously. But now, it was largely defunded, and news companies blamed the resulting forest wildfires on the highly non-linear relationship between carbon and climate, and the Milankovich cycle changes that our planet was undergoing. Instead of blaming the reduction in forest maintenance funding. This was irresponsible reporting; as lazy as blaming arson on climate change, and felt as though it was surreptitiously meant to sell electric cars and solar panels. 

Other State Parks had just zip-tied a small message to the fire grate. A suggestion to not have a fire, which had been ignored by 1-2 parties at each campground that I had visited. But at this campground, a round steel plate had been locked over each fire pit. To really reinforce that no fires were allowed here, due to the extreme wildfire risk. No parking in tall grass, said a sign on the bathroom building, to keep mufflers from igniting the underbrush. Even smoking was banned, to prevent a discarded match or cigarette cherry tip from becoming an ignition source. I wasn't worried about my electronic cannabis vaporizer, as it didn't create flame, and had an on/off switch. That was the important part - not really preventing flame, but preventing a large hot mass - any blackbody radiator with enough thermal inertia to spontaneously combust plants. The temperature in that one book's title. It was also why propane was still allowed, despite it also creating a flame, it couldn't get hot enough to ignite (or even bake) plants. Most of the heat in propane cooking came from the gas ignition, which could also be turned off. The metal burner did get hot, but it wasn't that large, and didn't store that much heat - relative to a campfire or car muffler. 

Felt like I was cheating on the little orange tent because it was so cute. But this was beyond spacious to be expansive: exploration of space. The 10x10 pavilion gave me 100 square feet of space, and the attachtent was about another 100 square feet. While the orange tent was just 4x6 for 24 square feet of space - too small for the air mattress. I woke up with wet feet more than once, due to my feet pushing the sleeping bag against the wet-with-dew tent wall, as my head pushed against the opposite wall. Adding insult to injury was vertical space, with the pavilion and attachtent each being about 5.5 feet tall, for about 550 cubic feet of space each. The orange tent's 3 foot height, and pyramidal shape, give it just 36 cubic feet of space. So it should be possible to fit about 30 orange tents inside the pavilion and attachtent combined. A disadvantage from the orange tent was that went up fine without stakes in the ground, while the attachtent was like most other wall tents in requiring stakes to generate wall tension. The attachtent was about as much work to disassemble and pack as the orange tent - I kept going over the steps, and once the pavilion was up, I would roll it out, put in one pole or snap to pavilion, put in other pole, stake down. Striking was the opposite, with the orange tent folding in half and half again, and the attachtent rolling up from either side, then rolling up those 2 rolls around the poles. Packed, they were about the same volume in different shapes. What I didn't get why most 4 person tents were many times larger than 3 person tents. Was the expectation for 3 small people, and the 4th person would be very large? "CharleMagne and his dwarfish retinue, this fall on the Boron cable network." 

# A Seedy Place

Like French press, one of the downsides to knife coffee was having to dispose of the grounds. And like French press, I usually threw the water and grounds at plants. Between my campsite and the road was a shady patch with a few withered little plants, doing their best in the dry heat. Being a plant was like being a person in a coma - you still needed air and water, and space to exist within - but you didn't have a neuroprocessor full of neural networks to help you get these. On my first morning, I splashed this one little plant with my grounds. 

Also I remembered about mashing potatoes and got a few reds. Mashing was easy: the potatoes would be washed, sliced, and then boied. Using a pot about twice as big as the ingredients seemed to work best. Smaller chunks cooked faster. Just like rice, I gave the green onions a haircut over the boiling potatoes. Used a fork to check how done they were and when the fork slid off easily, the boiling water was drained. I used a fork to mash 'em, pushing each potato chunk into the floor of the pot, but my mother had a potato masher which was about as much work. Then I mixed in a tablespoon or so of butter, and a splash of half-and-half. A little bit of half-and-half or milk went a long way, and a little too much made it soupy, I had learned as a teenager. Red potatoes were one of my secret weapons. They had more potato flavor than most potatoes, and give potato salad a very potato kick. I like to use them for everything - baking, mashing, stewing. It made me want to go back to Bellingham during the potato harvest and get a 50 lb bag of baking-sized reds.

# Wrong Kind Of Male

The next day, the little plant was looking much happier and more green. Leaves were more firm and less wilted. The whole plant was doing better. So I spread the love and splash the little plant next to it. Occasionally a horn-whistle blew at some distant rail crossing. There was a rail right next to the road, putting the campground entrance just after the rail crossing. Despite this, I didn't hear a train that close, nor did I see any trains blocking traffic. I drove to Dayton for ice. Coming back, I went for a walk around the loop, to break up the monotony. Going around was almost eerie, with 3/4 of the sites empty. I realized that each person in the campground wasn't a potential threat, but a potential resource, since we numbered so few. One site had 3 tents and no people nor cars. 4 over was a site with 2 tents, 2 cars, 1 adult, 1 kid, and 1 dog. Around the loop, past the extra vehicle parking lot and the water spigot, this site had a couple with a single truck and a camper. A few over, this family had a 30-foot Class B RV and a lifted pickup. They run their generator all day, then eventually it shuts off around 1 PM. An hour or so later, the truck drives off for a bit, and when it returns the generator restarts. Probable fuel run. Generator ran into the night. The nights were loud with crickets. Almost as loud as at Big Cedars. And better, almost every time I had to go at night, I would return to find 2-3 female crickets sitting on my picnic table. "Sorry, I'm the wrong kind of male," I apologized to a couple of the very little ladies during one trip. 

# I never did see a moose. 

Late the next morning, the gasoline generator restarted and ran through the day. It might have seemed like drunken laziness, or it might have been a carefully-crafted plan to power the RV outside of the park's quiet hours. Por que no los dos?

"Moose spotted - use care, as these gentle animals can be dangerous if spooked. Stay away from mothers around their children" said another sign on the bathroom building. Across the road from the loop's bathroom were the walk-in sites. They were more rustic, with less underbrush, and generally just an cleared area of bare ground. Just past them flowed the Touchet river, lower than the Satsop had been at Schafer. Despite this, the occasional fish flowed along with the river. 

Having a footlong sandwich kept nagging at me. I researched how to have a low-sodium sandwich from the footlong store. The how-to website recommended whole wheat bread, oven-roasted chicken - the whole breast, not a cold cut, and Swiss cheese among other choices. Swiss, I learned, becuse it often only had 2% of your daily sodium per slice. Instead of the 7% common for most other varieties of cheese. To put this another way, 4 slices of Swiss had just a little bit more sodium than 1 slice of most other cheeses. The sandwich would end up with about half of the day's sodium, but if done right, should be more than half of the day's food.

Nightfall brought rain, just as predicted by the weather app, and the fat raindrops were welcome. But there weren't very many, so this didn't do a lot to abate the dry and dusty situation. These golden grasses were dry stalked and would make great tinder for starting a fire - and once one started, it would quickly become a hillside inferno.

# The Bird Came Back

Like at other places, after about 4 days, the songbirds and other critters were used to my routine. A small red bird kept going underneath my table, trying to to get the oatmeal and rice bits that I had dropped. I would have to stop working, scold it to go away, and start working - just to see it going under my table 5 minutes later. 

The campsite had the table in a perfect spot, under a huge tree with branches just high enough for the pavilion, a space behind for the attachtent, and space in front for the car to fit sideways on the parking strip. This way, I could open the car trunk opposite the attachtent and create a 35 foot by 10 foot open-air living space - exploration of space! The car side of the table became the kitchen, and the tent side became the lounge. I usually work from my kitchen - one of the downsides to this stratification of off-grid was proximity to battery. Since it and the inverter were in the trunk, the laptop had to be within the length of its adapter to charge. Or use an extension cord, which only got you a couple dozen more feet, and was another object to wrangle. 

Different park, same rhythm. Across the state highway to the day use area in the morning, back for the afternoon, and I just stayed put for the evening. 

Sitting under a large maple. I was staring at a tree leaf while high when I made the connection - it was about as big as the sidewalk light's solar panel, so it probably produced the same 1 Watt of energy. Here, instead of knocking the electrons off silicon molecules, the photons were causing the photodisassociation of water inside of chloroplasts. I did some quick Internet searches and then quick math. The energy would be stored as glucose or similar, pushing about 2/3 of a cup back into the tree limb every day, which acts as ballast. Like an off-grid kit. Or maybe 1/4 of that much glucose - it made me wish I had majored in botany or arboreal biology instead of information systems and finance in college. 

# And Toss I Did

By my last morning, the whole patch was looking just a bit greener and happier from my coffee grounds and water. Back towards Richland - home - and I finally got to dispose of all of my empty propane canisters. Horn Rapids transfer area had a bin for us Benton County residents to just toss them into. I had 12 empty canisters altogether - at about $5 each, that's close to $12 in fuel and $48 in assembled steel canister. From here, I wasn't sure if I was going to get a tank and exchange it, or upgrade my inverter and battery to the 2000 Watt and 1200 Watt hour models. Or maybe just keep using canisters and hold either upgrade for next season. Next stop: Hood Park again. This far south, instead of a dust storm, rain was predicted. 

"I'm not sure what happens when these 2 meet," I joked with a couple of other guests as we waited for the gatehouse to open, "flying mud?" One looked away before he started laughing, like he was trying not to. Back on the grid was like easy mode. I didn't need to constantly watch the panels nor angst over clouds stealing my sunshine. 

"I didn't look at the map when I made the reservation," I told the ranger at the gatehouse, "so I'm probably in a weird spot." 

"Yes," he agreed," you're in a corner here, and share a driveway with another campsite." Finally, I was right about something. It was a hike, but not as far as last time. 

After getting settled, I drank deeply of both knife coffee and riff movies. It was sunny, so I put the panels out despite the hookups. Starting at 11 Volts (2 bars), the battery hit 12 Volts (3 bars) within 30 minutes, 13 Volts (4 bars) within an hour, 14 Volts (5 bars) within 90 minutes, and the "high voltage" light within 2 hours. Checked the light meter and it was getting 89,000 lux here.

# Suit And Tie

In the early morning, an older man with a graying beard and wearing a nice dark suit exited the RV next to me, and walked up to the bathroom building. A bit later, he returned and a matriarch in a nice dress emerged from the RV. They entered his lifted truck and quietly drove out of the still-sleeping campground. I didn't know where they were going, but guessed they might be attending local religious services. 

A downside to the attachtent was that it needed the pavilion to stay up. Which was complicated by the high winds common around the Tri-Cities area. 20 MPH winds proved a challenge, requiring me to "unbatton the hatches" and open the top and side windows, to allow the winds to flow freely through them. The pavilion would have become a flying umbrella, but for the stakes holding it down. I sat up the hill, enjoying the warm winds with a can of water. "Is this really my life?" I asked myself, with a grin. 

# Improving Society

Ice Harbor Dam had an Indian Memorial, but it was closed, with Restricted Access signs and small barricades. I passed it again on the way out of the park. Likely a memorial of Natives, and not people from India, but Christopher Columbus's geographic mistake persisted into the Information Age, alongside Julius Caesar's calendar mistake. Roman Empire thought of the day: His calendar's 9th month was named "seventh month" and so forth. It was probably possible to walk past those and see the memorial, but also probably not legal. Certainly more hassle than I wanted - I had enough trouble living my life as it was. I didn't even try to visit the Visitor's Center because the sign said "Gate Ahead". 

"Anything helps," said the sign held by a beggar standing on Volland. He was standing next to a grocery cart full of sleeping bags and clothes, perpetuating the homeless stereotype. Next to the "Say No To Panhandling" sign - ironically or not, I was unsure. A black dog with a mostly-white face slept under the bushes by his cart. "Don't let being homeless hold you back!" I shouted at him as I pulled into traffic, just as I had to the beggars on East Heron. I had difficulty abiding by beggars, as they weren't helping our society to grow and improve. Even buskers improved our society, by filling it with live music. Especially the amplified buskers in downtown Seattle.

I got another extension cord. This time, I was much more aware of what I was buying: 16 gauge could carry up to 13 Amps without eventually overheating, said the box. My kettle drew 12.5 Amps, no worries there. The double-burner, however, could draw up to 15 Amps. I realized that the burners had basically 6 settings each, going 1 to 5 and then MAX - 12 if added together. Some quick math gave 15 / 12 = 1.25 Amps per number on the dials - so if either were set to 2, or both set to 1, it should be using 2.5 Amps. Since 12.5 / 1.25 = 10, I could set the dials to a total of 10. This meant that if 1 burner were set to MAX, then the other shouldn't go above 4. Or both could be at 5. This worked out, since I was usually frying on one burner at MAX while boiling rice on the other at 2 or 3. Stepping up to 14 gauge would fix this, but at what cost? Triple. 

# Easy Mode

Easy mode continued at Charbonneau Park. This campground had a hill in the center, with the loop going around and up one side, giving half of the sites an amazing view of Lake Sacajawea leading to stately Ice Harbor Dam and Locks. The Columbia River had 14 dams directly on it, and the watershed had 60, stretching from Montana to Wyoming to Nevada. Different organizations ran different dams, and with different objectives. While the Army Core of Engineers (ACOE)'s goal was to prevent flooding and encourage public use of these bodies of water, the Bureau of Reclamation (BoR) encouraged irrigation and municipal water uses, and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA)'s primary goal was electricity generation. Almost all of the dams generated electricity as a way of paying for themselves. Water rights also got sold - the price rose in 2024, to about $4000 per acre-foot (about 325,851 gallons) for about $0.012 per gallon. If an ear of corn required 30 gallons of water to grow, then this 3.6 cents in water could be reflected in the price at the store. So each ear might cost an entire cent more this year than last, due to water price alone. This became a natural source of inflation. Between validations, I watched a massive green barge float across the river-lake, probably laden with logs and destined for the Pacific. 

# A Woman With A Toddler

Sacajawea was a diplomat and a key part of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Were it not for her and her son, other natives could have easily mistaken the otherwise all-male band of travelers for a war party. So said an interpretive sign. There wasn't anything going on at the campground and I was bored. This wasn't sexism, just pragmatism, as no native leader would send a woman and child into battle - not even as a ruse, nor as a human shield. Far from being a burden, the expedition members enjoyed teaching and playing with the young boy in the pre-phone era. And on her trip home, Sacajawea had a blast, introducing her weird new friends to everyone she met. This place - Charbonneau park along Lake Sacajawea - felt like it should be a marriage reunion. Because Toussaint Charbonneau did come west after a few years, looking for his wife and son. Seeing a 40-foot RV with "Friendship" on the side pull into the spot next to mine in the loop made me reconsider. Despite having the approachable word on the side, I didn't see this guest much. For some, camping meant changing the view outside their RV's window, while keeping the rest of their life the same - watching the same evening game shows on satellite TV every night. And why not - camping should be for everyone, not just us shade tree survivalists. 

# Distracting Darling

While washing dishes, I became distracted by a pretty woman jogging by, and dropped the mess kit's half-quart pot while washing it. The rivet holding the folding handle in place broke off. "Really?" I loudly voiced my frustration to nobody in particular, reflexively. I had just bought a 1 quart pot from Walton's World, and 1.5 quart pot from WinHeart. So I put the freshly-washed and damaged pot into the trash, and made oatmeal in the already-clean 1 quart pot. It was weird that it broke, because I had been holding it over grass, but somehow it hit the water faucet's concrete drain base. I kinda thought that maybe my body had made me drop the pot against the drain base, so I would be forced to use a larger pot for oatmeal, and make a larger serving. Sigh. One thing that the mess kit had helped me with was portion control, and just like earlier, I was probably going overboard. 

# Mushroom Moisture

It was good to just recharge. I hadn't realized how much this lifestyle, coupled with the diet change, had impacted my energy levels. But I was still bored. Mushrooms like being dry, I learned. I was finallly researching why mine were going bad so fast. Humidity was one major difference between my fridge and the common 21st Century refrigerator: humidity. Most fridges had enclosed A/C systems that would push cold and dry air over foods. While mine worked by storing excess heat in water's state change from solid to liquid, and sometimes from liquid to gas. My fridge's high humidity was the problem - and the solution immediately sprang to mind: keep the mushrooms sealed within the nearly air tight plastic round containers. 

# Friends Aren't Forever

As I made my coffee on Friday, a Pasco Fire & Rescue ambulance went around the loop. No lights nor sirens, so maybe they attended to someone earlier in the loop, and were taking a stabilized patient quietly with them? 3 for the season didn't felt too bad, compared to the sometimes-weekly ambulances I'd seen when hotelling in Factoria in 2021. 

"Heading out?" My neighbor finally broke the ice, asking hopefully as he saw me packing to leave. Possibly eager to have my "eyesore" of paltry and dented equipment removed from his view of the park and river-lake. 

"Yep," I replied with excessive concision. This friendship didn't even get to 5 minutes.

# Start Passing Motorcycles

Brooks Memorial was like Lewis and Clark Trail (East) in having a lot of seclusion but not a lot of humidity. Unlike that park, it was along US-97. After leaving Toppenish, US-97 was mostly downhill to the Columbia. But not entirely, and I kept pace with a group of 4 motorcycles as we crested a hill at 80 MPH, 2 ahead and 2 behind. The group of 4 tried to overtake me in the passing lane, but I was distracted by the scenery I hadn't seen before, so only 2 could before the lane ended. I debated passing them, but there was a lot of oncoming traffic and I was feeling lazy. Unlike Bridgeport, this was a much busier section of US-97. Eventually they left me behind, with their willingness to pass around the "lap traffic" greater than mine.

"Allowed equipment: 1 tent" said the reservation website. That's odd - usually they let any RV or trailer that would fit. "It's an adventure" I told myself, and that we'd learn when we get there why RVs won't fit. Stopped at dinosaur station in Toppenish for gas. Still had about 1/2 of a tank, but the price here was closer to $3 than $4 per gallon, so I stopped in to stock up. While fueling, I saw an ambulance go through the intersection. That one didn't count. Arriving at the campgrounds, I saw that RVs weren't allowed in these sites because the campground had 3 sections: A main slope with hookups and long pads. A back terrace above with good tent site, but RVs and vans couldn't fit. And a back area a few minutes down a single-lane road behind and above the back terrace - RVs won't fit there either, and it was a single road for both ways. It would be awful to have a faceoff between Class A RVs, with neither able to effectively back up. As it was, entering my site required driving in front of my neighbor, then backing around 3 corners. 

Deployed the pavilion & attachtent. The ground was so dry and packed that the front-most stakes barely went in enough to anchor the tent. I took a break between each stake. The campsite on one side held a small family with an SUV and two tents. The man was asking the woman a lot of questions, and I tried to tune out his voice. On the other side, 5 bikers were sharing a site. 4 were the ones who passed me, dressed in leather and denim, and the 5th arrived about 20 mintues later. 

After deploying my temporary structures, I found no signal - an all too common plight. I was betting that Goldendale would have signal and headed down there. Just like Aberdeen, Grayland, Grays Harbor, and Tokeland could have been named for the cloudy weather, Goldendale and Sunnyside seemed to be named for the sunny weather. On the highway down, I saw "Goldendale Observatory State Park" signs. Observatory what? And sure enough, after going down the steep hill to Goldendale, then back up another steep hill, sat an observatory with a parking lot. The building had a slotted dome roof on one end, common for observatories - and external public bathrooms on the other, common for State Parks. "2 shows daily - Solar (starts 3pm) and Night (starts 8pm)" said a sign. It was about a quarter to 4, and the parking lot was empty except for a Korean-brand white coupe. So out went the panel, up went the hotspot, TV tray, and chair unfolded onto the sidewalk behind my car, across the parking lot from the observatory. Laptop and mouse went onto the TV tray. Powered on the inverter and started working. A family drove up, and the dad knocked on the door that said: "Next show 8 PM." 

"Can my son get into the next show?" He asked, with hope in his voice. They weren't speaking very loudly, but I could hear them clearly from across the parking lot. 

"Sorry - each person adds 4 minutes to the line, and there were 4 objects to see, so adding 4 people would add 64 minutes to the show length," answered the park ranger from inside the door. 

A little later, a tall young lady with a large German shepherd said from a car length away, and started saying that my panel reminded her of her parents' setup. "It's just like my parents - they're offgrid too!" She exclaimed, then said that they had a dozen panels on their house. I started telling her about the system, but before long, the dog started getting antsy and had to continue their walk. "I need to start carrying business cards again," I told myself. After finishing up at work, I headed back through Goldendale to the highway, then north to the campground.

Vault toilet again, and I forced myself to make peace with them. Water faucet next to vault, just like at Potholes. Implied that they could have made a bathroom with running water, for hand washing at least, if not flushing. Indeed, about 1,500 feet away sat a full bathroom building for the other 2 loops, with flush toilets and showers. This loop felt like it was made intentionally rustic. Just as in Lewis and Clark, these golden grasses were dry stalked and would have made great tinder for starting a fire - and once one started, it could quickly become a hillside inferno. Unlike that park, only zip-tied suggestions were in place, no steel enforcement. The road made a roundabout around the water faucet, and the clearing in the trees would have made a perfect place for a saucer-shaped UFO to land. Fun fact: actual flying saucers had their drive on the bottom, so they took off vertically, then had to rotate 90 degrees before travelling paralell to Earth's surface - not unlike early VTOL jets whose engines were fixed to the frame, and the plane would rotate to face the sky in order to land. To my knowledge, only terrestrial guests visited the campground during my stay. Being nestled between high ridges made this campground also feel like Easton insofar as the late sunrise and early sunset, and early sunset brought an early end to the day. Just after sunset, the 5 bikers in the site next door were having some kind of vigil, so I waited for them to finish before using my noisy ultrasonic toothbrush. 

# Cathartic Cathode

In the morning, the bikers were gone before I had my second cup of coffee. At this point, I started to feel like there wasn't much more challenge to be had. I had stayed at most State Park campgrounds for several days, and was planning Round 2 for a few of them. So much had happened this summer that I didn't want to forget, so I pulled out the media laptop and started typing. Before I knew it, 3 cups of coffee and most of the day had turned my eidetic memory into over 30 sets of notes and recollections. I was shocked to see both the sun starting to set, and the foundation of a solid story. After dinner, I felt compelled to continue writing. 

# Holding Down The Fort

Morning. Heated water. Struck attachtent. Coffee and oatmeal. Struck pavilion. An easy pack-and-go down the hill. Stopped into a laundromat in Goldendale to do overdue laundry - but too few machines meant I didn't get everything washed. Got down the hill and into the campground. On return, I understood the campground a lot better. The State Park, and Native Fishing Site next door, were the last turn-off from US-97 before crossing the Columbia into Biggs Junction.  Several fast food restaurants and gas stations were visible through the trees, about a quarter mile or so across the river-lake. Maybe if cannabis were to become a Schedule 3 drug, I might feel homologated to venture across state lines. But until then, I was sticking to this State. I didn't want to risk accidentally committing a Federal crime because of something silly like a drug dog finding several mostly empty vape cartridges buried somewhere deep in the tote system. Checked in at the gatehouse. Up went the pavilion and attachtent. Life was good. I went to sleep.

"Ker-creak! FlapFlapFlapFlapFlapFlapFlapFlap! Slam! Ker-creak! FlapFlapFlapFlapFlapFlapFlapFlap! Slam!" I woke to the pavilion pullling against the attachtent's stakes and starting to take flight. Moving quickly in the darkness, I stood up inside the attachtent and grabbed the pavilion's metal frame through the attachtent's fabric wall, holding both in place. I get out and start removing the velcro straps that hold the canopy onto the metal pavilion frame. Without it, the attachtent was straining to stay together in the gusts. In another panic, I scramble everything out and into the car backseat. Pavilion had a bent leg. Oh God, my tent leg! It wasn't going to come down! I pushed harder and bent the leg just right, and...the slider moved past the bent spot. Into its carpet bag. Pulled half of the stuff out of the back seat and into the wind, tossed in the pavilion, and tossed everything back on top of it. I slept in the car, driver seat, using my shirt as a pillow. And woke up a couple of times with a numb skull and remembered not to sleep in that position. Looking around near the end of the night and start of the morning, the group camp and all 3 loops were full, and all tents were up. Most tents had extra tie-down strings running to extra stakes, for this very reason. This was when I recalled that Maryhill was a premier site for windsurfing, due to the high winds, and realized that there were a lot of surfboards and similar watercraft on the various cars, trucks, and vans.

# This Wasn't 20 MPH Mode. 

The campground charged a premium for premium ice, so I headed up the hill to Goldendale every second day, sneaking a single piece of spicy fried chicken and a few jo-jo potatoes each time. Their 20 lb bag of ice was only about triple the price of WinHeart's 7 pound bags. Just south of Goldendale sat a scenic viewpoint featuring a view of 4 Cascade mountains: Rainier, Adams, St. Helens, and Hood. This face of Rainier didn't have the scoop, and Little Tahoma was also hidden. Unfortunately, the other 3 mountains weren't "out." This was to say that clouds, smoke, pollution, magician, or something else hid each promience from view, as would happen on some days. Rain clouds were the usual cause in the Seattle region, but the wisps of wildfire smoke in the air here suggested another cause.

This was Labor Day, another Federal holiday, so I didn't open the work laptop. And the panel stayed in the car, due to the wind. The campground emptied out early, with all of the windsurfers eager to strike camp before hitting the windy waves, so I waited a bit to avoid some embarassment over failing with the pavilion. Eventually, I put up the orange tent and inflated my mattress again. I found damage beyond just the pavilion, as my phone also got damaged - the screen became damaged to where the 60% in the center didn't work, and also wouldn't work enough to unlock by PIN. Then noticing a dime-sized hole in the tarp bottom of the orange tent, I realized that both of my tents were damaged in addition to the phone. Definitely not 20 MPH mode. 

Later that evening, I get a funny feeling about the weather, and up went the hotspot. I didn't have a working phone, so had to use a laptop to look up the weather. A sticker from my coffee went onto the orange tent while the hotspot booted. Checking a weather site, I saw that tonight would be even worse:

    Tonight - Patchy blowing dust between 8pm and 11pm. Partly cloudy, with a low around 62. Breezy, with a west wind 25 to 28 mph, with gusts as high as 48 mph.
    Tuesday - Sunny, with a high near 83. West wind 13 to 21 mph, with gusts as high as 29 mph.
    Wednesday - and after would be a return to 5-9 MPH winds. 

Quickly striking the orange tent - and ripping another hole, in the wall support sleeve this time - I piled everything back into the car. The National Weather Service website displayed a warning: "Large vehicles may become difficult to control." I wasn't leaving my green stove out in that. Back into the car went each of my belongings. Being prepared this time meant I lined the driver's seat with my quilt. Pulled out the driver's seat headedrest and put it in backwards, so it would be more comfortable to sleep on. Standing next to the car, I evaluated the trees. The Seattle region got windstorms in the late fall and early spring most years, downing trees to block roads and damage buildings & utilities on a biannual basis. These trees all looked healthy and full of leaves. No dead branches, and espcially important, no dead trees. Deadwood broke off and blew over in windstorms more easily than living trees, and too many parks had too many dead and dying trees, but not here. Lastly, no branches directly overhead, to fall on my car. These verdant hulks were well-groomed by the area's strong winds and didn't worry me. 

# Circle The Vans

The Columbia wasn't a river anymore as much an inland series of dammed lakes that slowly and placidly moved towards the ocean. When allowed to run wild, it had unpredictable floods - like those that wiped out Vanport. Damming and flooding the lower Gorge raised the river level by 90 feet in places, wiping out towns including Columbus and displacing Natives from their centers of work and play. So said a few interpretive signs bordering the day use area. This campground had a Native fishing area next to it, which was basically a sandlot with river access, where Modern Natives could park their cars and cast a line into the water. The Big River, it used to be called, and it used to overflow with salmon, a fish strong enough to swim sometimes hundreds of miles upstream. A single net fisher could bring in a couple hundred per hour, said an interpretive sign at another campground. No longer, as most fish weren't smart enough to navigate a fish ladder, and most of the watershed's 60 dams didn't even give a fish the opportunity to try. This wasn't unlike the lobsters of New England, which used to be so prolific that they would wash ashore, and the preColumbian residents were so tired of eating them that they ground up this seafood for crop fertilizer. And the early European immigrants to New England had a similar reaction - being so ashamed of having an abundance of this bottom-feeder that they tried to hide from tourists what's now considered to be a delicacy. 

The 3 loops in this section of the campground were empty, except for myself and one family in the farthest loop. The windsurfer's playday was over. They were in the site I had last time I was here, but they had no large family next door to contend with. Their screen house had a few mattresses inside. No idea what their plan was for the wind, or if they were even aware of the impending gale. One van-lifer showed up - in a bright yellow 20 foot moving truck. "Truck Rental" was painted under the rental company's name in blue letters. I had so many questions and got none of them answered. 

Then another in a badass truck-van with Illinois plates. The truck-van tried to back in, went diagonal. Tried to back in again, diagonal again. I was confused how they were having this much trouble - this loop was a small circle, about as big as a traffic calming circle in Seattle. So you could drive around past your "driveway" pad and then back into it. Truck-van tried to back in a 3rd time, turned too much and ended off the parking pad. This driver hadn't pulled the vehicle far enough around the circle to back directly into their spot, and had been trying to compensate by over-turning. 4th time had them perpendicular to the pad, with front wheels off the left side of the pad and back wheels off the right. I was wishing I had popcorn. 5th time was the charm, with them backing in just right. Out came an active elderly couple, with the man playing with the phone app that controlled the van, and the woman nagging him. They made a cute couple, even in later life. Maybe he needed the nagging in some weird way - I didn't know what his mother had put him through. 

They stood next to the van as he used the app, turning on the parking lights and closing the door. Then they went for a walk around the park as the cloudy sky dimmed into dusk. A third van-life couple showed up - this one in a German-brand van designed for the 20th Century van lfe, and British Columbia plates. They parked in one of the bathroom building's 3 parking spots, and the woman of the male-female couple went to read the check-in information. A few of us in the loop went over to see if we could help, and as we approached, she turned around to ask some questions.

"Where do we check in? The gatehouse was closed. The sign says the 'HB' sites are available - what does HB mean?" She asked.

"Oh - HB is hike and bike, no cars," I replied, trying to be helpful. "But other sites should be available. The sign should mention either a yellow phone, or a phone number..." Having lived in State Parks for most of the summer, I felt obligated to be an ambassador, at least i some small capacity.

The winds were whipping through the trees as clouds fought angrily overhead. I laid in my driver-side bed, took a cannabis edible, and cannabis-vaped myself to sleep. The trees rustled often and loud, but 48 MPH winds were normal for a small car, especially head-on. On one of my nightly trips, I saw the family in the other loop strike camp in a panic, as winds continuously whipped through the trees. I knew the feeling, and hoped they got home (or into a hotel) safely as I watched their dark blue American-brand full-sized van drive away. The 3 of them could probably have slept in the van at the campsite, but oh well. At some point during the night, a 4th van-lifer arrived in her newer pale American-brand 8-passenger van with Oregon plates. 

# Unpaid Salesperson

Morning woke me into a familiar rhythm. The morning winds weren't that bad, and soon I had my solar panel shining in the morning sun. After catching up from the long weekend as the vanibund departed, I again put up the attachtent after putting up the pavilion. One leg of the pavillion was so damaged near the top that it barely went up. In the morning, a foam matress and a large roll of canvas and tarpulain still littered the campsite in the other loop. It occurred to me that abandoned equipment could have made a significant quantity of the park's trash. I planned to contribute my share by leaving behind the damaged pavilion, and then pulling another from my celebration of the ephemerality of life, once back in Kennewick. 

"I wanted to ask you about your setup," said an older guy, wearing an olive green jacket over an olive green t-shirt and blue jeans, as he walked over from another loop. He had what looked like a pickup truck converted to sell lunches to construction workers, and then converted again to hold survival equipment and supplies. 

I sighed, feeling like an unpaid salesperson for the solar industry. 

"I like your tent" he said. 

Oh. This was new. 

# Epilogue

A rooster crowed in the distance as water boiled nearby. Dawn was nigh, and the few clouds in the sky glowed, reflecting the impending daystar's golden light. I was at Plymouth again, and realized that the birds weren't making long-distance calls to discuss the weather. There was only one reason that most animals would make a sound that loud, or any sound at all - they were extremely lonely and wanted someone to be with. Roosters made loud sounds for the same reason as crickets - to put their location into the brain of every possible mate within hearing distance, and to make those with experience anticipate the male's arrival. Possibly in a Pavlovian sense. Some time later, I realized that was also the purpose of loud cars.
