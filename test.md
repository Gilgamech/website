# About Us

Gilgamech Technologies is an organization intended to encapsulate and eventually monetize the odd ideas of its founder, Stephen Gillie. Originated in 2012 to develop a robot OS for Arduino devices, the organization has evolved with the needs of its founder to become the legal and logical container for his works. He is an apolitical, athiestic, aromantic, aseptic, ascetic, aspy, acey pale male, to describe mostly through negation. He has [14 years of professional experience](https://www.gilgamech.com/Resume/Stephen%20Gillie%20Resume.docx) in Cloud (compute, storage, network), Platform (Windows desktop, Server, Ubuntu, RHEL) and Infrastructure (AD, AzureAD, circuits, DNS, DHCP, ISPs, routes, routers, routing, security groups, SQL, SSL, subnets, switches, and VLANs). He loves to express ideas as software as a hobby, and has written tools ranging from this blog to a Steam player tracker to a versioning system for Zendesk KBs (before they added that functionality natively). Additionally, he's an avid gamer (playing mostly Roblox these days), musician (having been a member of several area marching, concert, and jazz bands), and athlete with black belts in both Hapkido and Taekwondo.

This is a personal and largely non-commercial website, ( [let me know if you want to give me money](contact.html) ) and statements are entirely the opinions of the founder.

**I want to come to your level, and 'defeat you as my enemy' by helping you until you become my friend. For this reason all of my public internet comments MUST be Hospitable, Engaging, and Constructive (HEC). Readers should feel welcome, connected, and informed. Comments which do not meet all 3 requirements need to be modified before posting.

The Gilgamech Technologies community is hospitable, considerate, and open to everyone - including those who hate each other. Open, but neither inclusive nor exclusive. Racism and sexism aren't welcome, but racists and sexists who can behave themselves are. All political viewpoints, just don't start a fight. The Canceled may join and leave as they please, so long as it's not overly dramatic. And likewise hate for canceled celebrities is not welcome - calm and civil discussion of their acts and consequences, but no 'fire-and-brimstone'. Those who dislike or heavily criticize me may also join and leave freely, so long as they voice their opinions in a hospitable and considerate manner.
