				<span class="popup">Definitions: (tap)<span style="text-align: left;">
				<ul>
				<li>Economics:</li><ul>
					<li>Ebidta: Earnings before interest, debt, taxes, and amortization.</li>
					<li>GilDollar: one year of economic activity for one average human, rounded down to 2021 equivalent $63,500. So 2021 equivalent $100,000 is 1.57 GD (100000/63500).</li>
					<li>GilCent: one working day of economic output, or 1/250 of one GilDollar, as 2021 equivalent $254. So 2021 equivalent $1270 is 5 GC.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Geography: </li><ul>
					<li>MegaAcre (MAcre): 1 million acres (4,046 km<sup>2</sup>, 1562.5 mi<sup>2</sup>, 0.4 MHectares). This measurement of area is somewhere between Rhode Island (1,045 mi<sup>2</sup> or 0.7 MAcres) and Delaware (1,954 mi<sup>2</sup> or 1.3 MAcres).</li>
					<li>MegaHectare (MHectare): 1 million hectares (10k km<sup>2</sup>, 3861 mi<sup>2</sup>, 2.5 MAcres). This measurement of area is slightly smaller than Kosovo (10.9k km<sup>2</sup>, 4.2k mi<sup>2</sup>, 1.1 MHectares, 2.7 MAcres).</li>
					<li>River rate: One CR = 7,500 m<sup>3</sup>/s (265,000 ft<sup>3</sup>/s) - this is the Columbia River's average flow rate.</li>
					<li>Titles: (Ocean, Sea, River, Mountain, etc) If it's in the 90th percentile for size or cultural significance, then the title goes before, otherwise it goes after.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Humans:</li><ul>
					<li>Name: JobTitle FirstName(# of their name) LastName [Translation] Titles/Epithets [Translation] (Country) - "Leader of the local human governance institution" is a job title.</li>
					<li>Person: A legal being, as recognized by a government.</li>
				</ul> 
				<li>Legends: stories of all kinds, from mythology to tradition to bedtime stories to major feature-length productions.</li>
				<li>Nation abbreviations:</li><ul>
					<li>DPR(N)Korea - The Democratic People's Republic of (North) Korea - is reunification just a dream?</li>
					<li>HREmpire, HREmperor, etc: Holy Roman Et cetera.</li>
					<li>NSGermany: National Socialism was a major disaster that resulted in millions of uninstalls. The existential crisis of this national movement was a fundamental insecurity about their equality with other humans, and this stems from the inherent ranking system that comes with an irrational obsession with arbitrary attributes.</li>
					<li>PRChina - 中国 (Zhōngguó) [Central Country] People's Republic of China holds the Yellow River Valley into the 21st century.</li>
					<li>ROChina - 中華 (Zhōnghuá) [Central Flower] Republic of China held the Yellow River Valley kinda between WW1 and WW2.</li>
					<li>RO(S)Korea - The Republic of (South) Korea - is reunification just a dream?</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Powers: Groups of humans which perform historical events and/or have an impact on other humans, and meet the following criteria. May also be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity">Polity</a>.</li>
				<ul>
						<li>Limited but functional government (maybe just one person)</li>
						<li>Well-defined boundaries, that may be highly mobile (i.e. geographical borders of the currently-inhabited area).</li>
						<li>Shared defense and resources.</li>
						<li>Common goals and mutual interest.</li>
					</ul>Examples:<ul>
					<li>Empire: Power large enough that one person alone cannot effectively provide goverance, and governmental power is split between several individuals.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Horizontal Empire: Split your state in half and give an ally full control over that half, but you're still friends.</li>
						<li>Vertical Empire: Get an ally to handle the day-to-day tasks while you focus on larger strategic matters.</li> 
						<li>Federation: Vertical empire with multiple allies split horizontally as peers.</li> 
						<li>Confederacy: Horizontal empire with a friendship club of leaders.</li> 
					</ul>
					<li>Micropower: Small or medium group of mobile humans, like a mobile nation or state.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Government is often one person or a small committee.</li>
						<li>Boundaries may be highly mobile.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<li>Square brackets [] contain translations.</li>
				<li>Temple - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple">from the Latin templum</a> - is a building reserved for spiritual rituals and activities such as prayer and sacrifice.</li>
				<li>Workdays: 250 days per year, from rounding down the 250.2422 working days in a year (365.2422 minus 104 weekend days and 11 holidays).</li>
				<li>Uninstall: We play Life on Super Hardcore Mode - it bans you from the server and deletes itself so you can't play again.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Covid-day is 8270 uninstalls, rounded from 5.58 million uninstalls in 675 days = 8267.</li>
						<li>Covid-rate is x/Covid-days uninstalls per day. For 1000 uninstalls per day, this is 12.09% Covid-rate.</li>

(Jupiter and Saturn kept going out until they orbitally rebounded against Neptune, pushing it into the Kuiper Belt and possibly causing the Late Heavy Bombardment. Ceres and the Asteroid Belt are still constantly disturbed by Jupiter - and the Kuiper Belt disturbed by Neptune, even in the 21st century, occasionally causing new comets and asteroids.)</td></tr>

It flowed to Hebes Chasma, where it formed a massive waterfall 10 km (6.21 mi) wide and 1 km (.62 mi) tall. After this, the water disappears, and some would eventually be transported to Mars' poles, forming the giant ice caps we see in the 21st century. (Most would be lost beyond the circumference of the atmosphere, as Mars' magnetic field is smaller than its atmosphere - Venus too - allowing the solar wind to literally blow away their water molecules. Another reason Earth is so weird - our magnetic field is gigantic, much larger than our atmosphere, safely guarding most of our water from the solar wind.)</td></tr>

</ul><p>Towns were larger, and more populated. These had permanent dwellings replacing the big gaps for temporary dwellings that used to exist between the buildings. Rectangular mud-brick rooms became popular dwellings as they could be packed closer together, and sometimes even share walls to reduce building costs. They usually had a small antechamber before entering the room. These had no doors, instead being accessed either by autofenestrating, or climbing out the ceiling. (Like Minecraft dirt huts - how did elderly people climb in and out?) Buildings were painted with a burned-lime (calcium) substance.</p>

Parts would receive 500 mm (19.6 in) of rain a year. Much of the Savanna Sahara would resemble India's sub-tropical savanna.

It was part of an extensive trade network, and imported obsidian from Cappadocia 170 km (105.6 mi) for processing into extremely sharp blades, and early polished mirrors.</p>
<p>Dwellings were a single room informally split in half. One side of the room was boring and full of grain in big stone or dried clay containers. (Pre-pottery - the process of baking clay hadn't been invented.) The other side was alive with home life, rituals based around hunting wild animals, and food prep - with a clay furnace and hearth directly underneath a dual-use roof hatch entrance, for furnace ventilation and also the ceiling ladder. As common decoration, two pair of bull horns set in plastered bunkers partitioning two sides of a ceremonial corner. Walls were painted with an alluvium plaster dug up from the lakebed, and many walls were painted with a humans-hunting-animals motif (possibly ritualistic) in red ochre. An especially iconic one has a bunch of people attacking a giant aurochs. (Proto-bull of heaven?) None of these motifs show any domesticated animals.</p>
<p>A dwelling would remain in use for decades, then be demolished through pulling out the roof supports, and a new dwelling bulit on the rubble. Archaeologogists have found 18 layers of rebuilding with ultrasonic ground scans. Remains of the uninstalled have been found entomed under floors in various dwellings, and a common belief is that the constant plastering was an attempt to cover up the decay.</p>
<p>While Çatalhöyük's population was increasing, Cafer Hoyuk &amp; Aşıklı Höyük were seeing population declines, meaning people were probably moving from the lame old city to the cool new city.</p>
<p>The Konya plain receives little rainfall and the soil is poor quality. But the Carsamba river flows nearby, and would have flooded the city often with large amounts of nutrient-rich silt, which would have supported lots of Einkorn and Emmer wheat, grass for grazing animals, fish, nesting birds, and reeds for weaving. Also there are several forests nearby. (Why *on* the lakebed, and not *next to* the lakebed?)</p> </td></tr>

<p>After this, Mykenaean-inspired pottery begins showing up in the Levant, like some Mykenaeans had moved there and were working with local clay. It's likely that whatever group started this picked up a few of each group when they raided them, and Egypt was seeing this motley crew because they were the last spot on the map. They weren't raiders like Vikings were, but bringing their wives and lives like refugees.</p>
<p>This occurred in the 3rd year of Ramesses3's reign - shifts with Egyptology's oft-revised timeline.</p>
<p>(Another theory, based on ideas in: <a href="https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/23588/is-there-a-link-between-the-sea-people-and-the-trojan-war">a StackExchange History post</a> - Hittites were militarily strengthened by trade and environmentally weakened by poor crops due to the Dry Event, and began to invade their neighbors. They had more swords than grain, and "when the going gets tough, the tough go Viking." But everyone was on the edge of rebellion due to perpetually low harvests, and this was the tipping point pushing numerous nations into open rebellion. They start with the Assyrians who had pressured them into that peace treaty with Egypt. The Hittites would walk or sail into an area, find that the locals have already raided the grain warehouses so *shrug* burn the warehouses I guess, and accept whatever locals wanted to join. People were looking for any way to escape the madness at this point - shelter in place with a big pile of grain, join the raiders, join the invaders, or flee as a refugee.</p>
<p>Then the Hittites attacked the Aegeans before they become a naval problem. Next Cyprus to secure the copper supply, and then down the coast, through Canaan and into Egypt. This caused a wave of refugees to rise up and flee in front of the invading Hittite forces, which is much of what Ramesses3 recorded, people bringing their husbands and wives and lives. And probably various rebel groups who managed to get to Egypt and were mixed in with their refugee countrypeople. This gave Egypt that chaotic mix of people looking for a fight, people defending themselves, and people looking for a home. Separately, mainland Greeks sack Troy and overthrow the Hittite kingdom, for ruining all of the good Bronze times. This was while the Hittite forces were in Egypt, and this is what the Trojan War epic tells through allegory and allusion. The thousand ships wouldn't be Greeks sailing to Troy, but all of the various groups fleeing the fighting, and troop transports bringing the fighting.)</p> </td></tr>

<p>This was why he was so keen on conquering Gaul, with a permanent base at Calais - where he planned to cross. 2 massive micropowers (4k humans) crossed the Rhine. When the snow melted, he met them, and their envoy said they had been forced out and needed relocation. He negotiated to buy time to close distance, then defensively attacked the micropowers. Micropower leadership came to personally apologize, but he had them arrested, which infuriated Cato back in Rome (Caesar had attacked the Veneti for doing the opposite). Without their leaders, the micropowers were disorganized and suffered a great rout.</p>
<p>He decided to cross the Rhine to punish the Germans. Instead of taking a ferry, he built a bridge (which he describes in excruciating detail) in 10 days. Vilages were empty because micropowers fled while he was building the bridge. So Caesar marched back and (partially?) destroyed the bridge. At least he got bragging rights of "First general to cross the Rhine with an army." Then, claiming the Britains were supporting Caesar's enemies in Gaul, to make this invasion a defensive one.</p>
<p>Transports could only take 2 of the 8 legions, and the ships with cavalry turned back in a small storm. On the island, Caesar was countered by British cavalry and chariots. They fought inland, created a fort, but kept meeting resistance so fled in the night, while waiting for another attack. On the way back, a boat of 300 infantry was blown deep into Belgae territory, and were surrounded by 6k Belgae fighters - Caesar ordered every cavalry unit to assist those soldiers.</p> </td></tr>

Except for in the morning, where a female slave brings to the eldest male fresh water, which he washes himself and spits and blows his nose into - then she takes this to the next eldest male, who does the same, through the household. They practice basically shintoism, leaving offerings to wood with a face carved or painted on it - sometimes a whole cow, and when wolves came to eat the cow, they would feel their spiritual lord was satisfied. Thiefs were vertically uninstalled from trees until the elements wore the bones bare. Funerals - poor people get a simple boat burial like LOTR with simple funeral garb, while rich people had their assets split in 3: 1/3 to household, 1/3 to funeral garb, and 1/3 to the alcohol to celebrate their life/uninstall. "They are addicted to alcohol" writes Ibn Fadlan, "they drink it night and day. Sometimes, one of them uninstalls, cup in hand." At uninstall, a poor person's slave uninstalls to be cremated with them - for rich people with several slaves, one of them would volunteer.</td></tr>

It records a few slaves, but the vast majority of field workers were free peasants. Danes held the eastern half of England, and had slightly different rules - keeping no slaves and few Serfs, and the ancient tradition of taxing based on the number of horned beasts that were kept. (A herd of livestock would be a pre-bank account display of wealth.) It cataloged a huge amount of the country in great detail, but ignores some huge areas. There are 283k men listed, but clergy, women and chldren, and London are not counted - leading to an estimated English population of 2 million to 2.5 million. Of these people, 95% lived outside cities, split between servile Serfs and free peasants. Villein was another word for Serf.</p>
<p>Peasants would report to a Manor, with a lord, who would hold 2-3 villages. Serfs worked 2-3 days a week for the lord, while free people paid rent. Serfs and lords had different rights to the lands, not unlike a landlord/renter relationship in the 21st century. One lord was fined 40 shillings (2 pounds Sterling, or about 2021 equivalent $7000 or 27.6 GC) for "thrashing" his Serf. A penny (1/240 pound Sterling, about 2021 equivalent $14.60 or .05 GC) per day was a common wage. Taxing involved using the lord's grain mill (which took a percentage), controlling where the Serf could live after marriage, and uninstall duty of a livestock animal - but usually not a direct financial requirement.</p>
<p>The Normans were against human slavery, and Bishop Anslem said "It should be wrong to sell a man like a brute beast." They put a stop to the slave trade between Bristol, and Dublin (which had been set up by the Vikings as a slave-trading port). They preferred to make a person legally free - that way they have to feed themselves instead of needing you to feed them - except that they're not allowed to move off their land, and you can tax him. (This is very similar to the Mongol system of just taking tribute in words and crops each year, and leaving the local social, farming, and market institutions in place.)</p></td></tr>

From a brunch menu:<ol>
<h5>Pie Aloes of Beef:</h5>
<li>Aloes [small meat rolls]: Saute 1 bunch chopped parsley and ¾ cup (29 g) fresh chopped thyme leaves until wilted. Chop 6 large hard-boiled egg yolks and combine with wilted herbs, ⅓ cup raisins, ½ cup pitted and chopped dates, and season with kosher salt. Slice 1 boneless mutton leg into thin slices. Spread half of this the egg yolk mixture onto the slices of mutton and roll up the parsley and thyme inside them.</li>
<li>Crust &amp; assembly: Whisk together 1.5 cups (350 g) flour and ½ tsp (3 g) kosher salt, then add 1 egg yolk and ¾ cup (154 g) melted lard and mix this together thoroughly. Add only enough hot water to knead into a smooth dough. Flatten into a circle between ⅛ and ¼ inch (3-6 mm) thick and about 17 in (43 cm) wide. Arrange the aloes in the center of the pie crust in a circular shape, leaving enough space to fold the edges over like a galette. Sprinkle a little sugar, cinnamon, saffron threads, &amp; salt on top of the aloes. Top with the remaining egg mixture. Bring the edges of the pie crust up around the aloes so that it forms pleats and leaves a hole at the top. Bake at 375 F (190 C) until done.</li>
<li>Syrup: In a small pot, break up 1 slice toasted white bread and add 1 cup (240 ml) white wine, ¾ cup (150 g) sugar, and 1 tsp (5 g) ground each cinnamon &amp; ginger. Simmer until the sugar is dissolved and the bread is mushy, and strain. Pour the syrup through the hole at the top of the pie after it’s done baking &amp; cooling.</li>
<h5>Ypocras Jelly (hippo-cras - a mulled wine set into jelly - aka wine jello shots):</h5>
<li>Gelatin: Add the 2 calves feet, 1 veal shoulder, 1 gallon (3.8 L) both water and white wine to a large pot. (Feet and shoulder are great sources of gelatin, and veal is mild.) Cover and bring it to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer and partially cover. Gently simmer for 6 hours - skim off any skum that rises to the top. Strain and discard the solids.</li>
<li>Mulled wine: Add 2 tsps (10 g) ground cinnamon, 1 tsp (5 g) ground ginger, and 2 cups (300 g) sugar to the gelatin mixture and mix well. Add some dark blue/purple food coloring (substituting for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrozophora_tinctoria">turnsole</a> berries). Portion into small glasses in the refrigerator to cool and solidify. </li>

(thus)</p> How: <ul>
	<li>Authority for specified individuals to dig for Saltpeter in likely places.</li>
	<li>Penalties for not allowing digging were going in front of one of many legal authorities, and being judged.</li>
	<li>Saltpeter-men had quotas to fill, and had to work from 30 minutes after sunrise, until 60 minutes before sunset.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>But pigeon houses had different hours: 9am-3pm. (Why?)</li>
	</ul>
	<li>So they could come by and disrupt your morning routine to dig a big hole in your outhouse, then fill it in.</li>
	<li>They could take your cart and use it to carry the bottles and buckets of what they dig up, but they had to pay you 8 pence (2021 equivalent $5.85 or 0.023 GC) per 1 mile (0.6 km).</li>
	<ul>
		<li>This is about 10.4x the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/standard-mileage-rates">US IRS 2021 mileage deduction</a> of $0.56/mile.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>They could take your bottles and jugs, and return them without paying you. (Did they have to clean them out?)</li>
	<li>They were exempt from taxes and tolls.</li></ul> 
	Why: <ul>
	<li>Gunpowder was expensive because the King starts a lot of wars, and they'd used up their national stash.</li>
	<li>Having this stuff on hand means repelling potential invaders, and keeping the country running.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Without more, they couldn't supply all of their navies, forts, and armies.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Foreign saltpeter sucks.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Other countries had banned selling saltpeter to them. (Because they don't want to be shot with their own saltpeter?)</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Gunpowder will be way cheaper.</li></ul></td></tr>

Mantle is cooled into new Juan de Fuca plate offshore along the Juan de Fuca ridge, pushing the Juan de Fuca plate north-northeast beneath the continental North American plate. The CSZ may be unique among the world's subduction zones in that it produces very few (if any) earthquakes unambiguously on the plate interface. The fault's frictional properties change with depth:<ul>
<li>Immediately below the locked part is a strip (the "Transition Zone") that slides in "slow slip events" that slip a few cm every dozen months or so. This transfers the plate boundary stresses from the Transition Zone to the locked part of the fault.</li>
<li>Below the transition zone geodetic evidence suggests that the fault slides continuously and silently at long term plate slip rate.</li>
<li>From its surface trace offshore to a depth of possibly 5 km, all remote from land, observations are few and it remains unknown whether the fault is stuck or slipping silently.</li>
<li>At depths shallower than 30 km or so, the CSZ is locked by friction while strain slowly builds up as the subduction forces act, until the fault's frictional strength is exceeded and the rocks slip past each other along the fault in a "megathrust" earthquake.</li>
</ul>Great Subduction Zones like the CSZ are the only source zones that can produce earthquakes greater than M8.5 - the CSZ has produced M9.0 or greater earthquakes - but it's not known if these zones can produce smaller than M8 earthquakes.</td></tr>

Before his investigation, it was known that UK was in debt, but nobody knew how deeply. UK was at war with every foreign lender, at war with Spain (blocking trade), taxation was politically impossible, and the Bank of England were controlled by the Whigs - Harley's political (Torey) enemy.</p>
<p>Harley partnered with James Blunt of the Hollow Sword Blade Company to form the South Seas Company. Their plan was to exchange ownership shares for Army Debentures, a promissory note the army would issue when they couldn't pay. They would charge 6% interest, which was lower than the army was paying individuals, and use the profits to buy land in Ireland. In the lead-up, they bought all the debentures they could to increase demand.</p>
<p>They got the 200k pounds (2021 equivalent $45.13 million or 710 GD) to buy land in Ireland, and 20k (2021 equivalent $4.51 million or 71 GD) to loan to the government. They also got exclusive rights from the UK government to operate in the South Seas (aka all ports in Central and South America). They advertised this heavily, even hiring the author of Gulliver's Travels to advertise, giving buyers confidence.</p>
<p>House of Lords members don't need election - until recently, any "Peer of the Realm" could be made a lord - so Harley jailed Whig party members Sir Robert Wapole, and John Churchill Duke of Marlborough, in the Tower of London. Then they got the Queen of England to add 12 new Peers, and now Parliament also wanted to end the war with Spain. But they left the war early, and so didn't get loot drops at the end, such as access to the ports. They ended up with slave trade, and 1 ship per year per port. This revealed the South Sea Company to merely be a bank.</p>
<p>Harley gets the UK lottery's administration rights (run the thing) given to Blunt, who modified the lottery so every ticket would pay at least 10% of its price, across the next decade. Tickets sold quickly and turned present debt into long-term debt.</p></td></tr>

<p>Smith viewed humans as social beings, and his life's work was developing a systematic understanding of how humans operate in society. This system is grounded in sympathy - a combination of empathy with the judgment and evaluation of others. Before this, people thought good things and bad things of all sizes happened because a deity made them happen. He gave the model that we're each independent players who react to what others do to us, not deity-controlled NPCs, and that society's morals should be based off this. And that we're all motivated by self-interest, where positive judgments in the sympathy give pleasure, and thus are in our self-interest.</p>
<p>To counter the criticism that selfish desires can harm others, Smith develops a Spectator within each person, who observes the person's behavior and others. That Spectator is who makes the judgments, against both ourselves and others. A crucial distinction Smith makes is between Justice (both social norms and actual laws) and Beneficence (being nice to people, holding doors, etc) - with beneficence but no justice, it's an untenably unjust society, while justice without beneficence is a livable-but-unpleasant society. This makes justice the most important moral foundation of society, and thus governments should enforce rules but not interfere with beneficence, as this might cause chilling effects.</p>
<p>Starting with humans as social beings, we strive for sympathy, tempered by the Spectator to be as impartial as possible. And we build social norms and laws around this impartiality, which was his vision for a free society of responsible people. </p>
<p>Beware the (Person) of System, he warned, who sees people as pieces on a chessboard - for they arrive with a vison in hand for a Perfect Order to Society. But people have their own laws of motion and aren't pieces on a chessboard. (Too often, this person's motivation is simple totalitarianism, where everyone else does what the person says or are punished.)</p></td></tr>

It reminded them of a huge incense burner. The upper part was made of red-coated rosewood with transparent windows, while the lower was covered in brazen plates. Inside was covered in text of an unknown language. Also inside were 2 bedsheets, 1 bottle with 3.5 L (0.92 gal) water, some cake, and kneaded (toughened) meat. Lastly there was a short beautiful woman of height 1.5 m (4.9 ft), with red hair and eyebrows, pale pink skin, and white hair extensions. Her clothes were smooth unknown fabrics. She didn't understand the fishermen, and they didn't understand her. She was polite but odd, clutching a quadrilateral box with sides of about 0.5 m (1.6 ft - this would have been 1/3 of her height) which she wouldn't let anyone touch. Recently, another woman with a similar box had washed up nearby, and also a board with a head pinned to it. So an elderly villager made up a legend that starts by disparaging her character and ends with her exiled to float in this boat with the head of a lover. Based on this new legend, they gathered the woman back into the ship and set her adrift again.</td></tr>

	<li>Democracy breeds materialism. European peasants had little option to make money, and landed aristocrats had no need of more, so money wasn't a status symbol - but US Americans felt it could be earned through hard work alone. (Like the Horse on George Orwell's Animal Farm.) Money is the only achievement that US Americans respected - "a book that doesn't sell well can't be very good." Making for an endless, but flat and mean, way to judge each other.</li> 	<li>Why are US Americans so restless in spite of their prosperity? Where inequalities are pronounced, they are largely accepted and ignored - but where any motivated person can take any job and we're all so equal, we become much more aware of the slight variations. Thus we focus more on keeping up with the Joneses than with how our material needs are almost completely met. Also, the entire country are the Joneses with whom we must keep up, whereas stratified layers reduced this to just humans in your stratum.</li>
	<li>The tyranny of the majority - democratic culture demonizes differences and minorities, even if they have benefit. "It's regarded as a civic virtue to take on anyone who seems to be getting above themselves and cut them viciously down to size."</li>
	<li>Democracy turns us against authority. People are used - trained even - to not defer to others, and so don't defer even to proven experts, such as doctors or authors. Thus democracy is "fatally biased towards mediocrity."</li>
	<li>Democracy undermines freedom of mind. He thought democracy would encourage open minds, but he found we trusted our system to be fair and just, so we stopped trying to think critically - and just accepted what newspapers wrote and what our "common sense" told us. Also, we're sensitive to our neighbors also being our customers, which had a chilling effect on free speech. -- He didn't mean these to be negative, just observations. He said to expect politics to be a rough ride when you give ultimate authority to everybody. (It's like the Edsel Disaster multiplied by the size of the country.

Tokugawa tried to fight back, but this led to further northern retreat all the way to Hokkaido island. After this, nation building:</p> <ul>
	<li>New modern currency of small metal and large paper units.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Tax reform, with a centralized taxing agency. This set the same rates everywhere, making business, trade, and life more fair for people.</li>
	<li>This collected taxes consistently, ensuring the government had a steady source of income for the first time ever.</li>
	<li>This steady income led to numerous infrastructure projects, such as electification, telecom, and railways.</li>

	<li>Forcing each daimyo and samurai into early retirement (with a pension).</li>
	<li>Everyone else is equal and Japanese, forming a national identity.</li>

	<li>Sexism was still encouraged but all children would get 4 years of basic schooling.</li>

	<li>There was a "Ready for a higher level of warfare" moment, when it was realized that these dubiously-loyal micropowers of samurai were worthless against platoons and brigades of trained troops.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Create a western-style conscript army with 3 years of mandatory service, where everyone trained and fought as "Japanese Soldiers" instead of micropower members.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Cultural changes:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Painting developed 2 new styles: Yoga (photo-realistic) and Nihonga (traditional and stylized).</li>
	<li>Western building materials led to a "modern" age in architecture, building traditional Japanese design elements with the new materials.</li>

<p>Aka Les Vingt (Les XX) [The20]. Their goal was to create a "total work of art" that would unify arts and crafts into a single framework.

<p>Inspirations were architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc (France), designer William Morris (UK), and the Arts and Crafts movement - all of whom wanted to tear down the barriers between folk crafts and high art. Further inspirations include the female body, medieval art, folk art, Rococo style, and especially Japanese art (from graphic design to jewelry to furniture). They were bored with the academics and historicism prevalent in 19th century artwork, and yearned for new styles enabled by new technologies including electricity, cinemas, and automobiles.</p>
<p>Despite the interest in new technology - as inspiration for art, as new materials to make into art, and as a means to reach a wider audience - members believed that industrialization and mass production would homogenize and desaturate art into a uniform and boring product. This belief joined with their desire to unify art, into a push for more naturalistic artisinal crafts, and naturalistic themes in high art. With flowing vines, leaves, flowers, gowned young women, and birds - these objects and people were hoped to blend beauty and function while they blended the classes.</p></td></tr>

This was the first modern ship sank by an iceberg.
<ul>
<li>11:38 PM - Titanic sights iceberg. First Officer orders a port (right) turn and engines full astern, to broadside the iceberg - this increased ship damage in exchange for a gentler collision for passengers. The shudder felt by passengers was likely from the engines, and the iceberg's damaging impact was apparently not noticeable.</li>
<li>11:40 PM - Titanic hits the iceberg. Officers were calm, like they were running a drill. Survivor Edith Russel said a ship officer told her "Don't worry, the Californian will pick everybody up, if you don't come back for breakfast."</li>
<li>11:45 PM - The fourth officer determines their position - but the location is 12 miles further west than their actual location, and The Californian couldn't see the Titanic through Earth's curvature.</li>
<li>11:50 PM - Captain Smith has the Titanic go half-speed for about 5 minutes, expecting the ship they see on the horizon to save them. It's not clear if this was the Samson, a seal uninstalling vessel, or another nearby ship.</li>
<li>12:05 AM - The Titanic shoots its first red-white-and-blue rocket. The captain of the Samson saw these but didn't check on the ship because they were on shady business - they shot their own plain-white rockets to call back their boats from illegally uninstalling seals on the icebergs. The Californian's crew could see plain-white rockets, not the red-white-and-blue rockets they were expecting.</li>
<li>12:15 AM - The Titanic sends its first radio emergency signal. The Californian's crew don't receive this because the telegraph operator is sleeping.</li>
<li>12:20 AM - Titanic officers start becoming agitated.</li>
<li>12:25 AM - Officers start pumps and prepping lifeboats.</li>
<li>12:45 AM - First lifeboat launched. Lifeboats were only being half-filled.</li>
<li>1:00 AM - Captain Smith realized the Californian wasn't going to rescue them, so they started filling lifeboats all the way.</li>
<li>2:20 AM - Titanic sinks, pulling numerous swimmers down into the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EtOAaK19bA">cold below</a>. 1500 people uninstalled (0.18 Covid-days).</li>
<li>5:25 AM - The Californian's radio operator wakes up, and they attempt to join rescue efforts, but find The Carpathia already there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Surving crew members were herded into a railway shed and kept for about 24 hours, before being required to sign an early NDA. This was accompanied by a threat of 20 years of prison if they said anything.</p>
<p>The UK Board of Trade (BoT) were Plaintiff and Defendent in this case, and also Judge and Jury. The BoT's corrupt inspectors rushed the Titanic's approval through, despite bulkheads being too short and having too few lifeboats. The BoT appointed 1st Viscount (Lord) Mersey John Bigham (UK) to lead their inquiry. Lord Mersey had his son arrange the venue, and they got the Scottish Drill Hall in London, whose acoustics were so bad that the audience couldn't hear the trial. Lawyer (solicitor?) Harold Sanderson, for shipyard Harland and Wolfe, repeatedly called the sunken ship Olympic.</p>
<p>At the trials, officers and crew were evasive and sometimes gave contradictory or confusing answers. They claimed they had been in the below-freezing water for more than an hour, which wasn't possible. But the trials were hastily arranged and failed to ask the right questions. Nobody asked the simple question of "If icebergs could normally be seen at 5 or 6 miles distance, why did the Titanic hit one?" The press were more interested in the drama of an officer's escape, and Lord Mersey ignored evidence he didn't like. The Californian's captain tried for the rest of his life to get the case reopened and his name cleared.</p>
<p>The justification given for a national coverup of the insurance scandal was the brewing WW1 - JP Morgan (USA)'s ownership the White Star Line (UK) involved letting the UK use the ships as naval reserve during wartime. But if the White Star Line went bankrupt, JP Morgan would be the primary creditor, and he would not have to let the UK use the ships (now his personal property) during WW1. So the White Star Line became Too Big To Fail as a military asset.</p>

	<li>DesDiv 32: USS Kennedy DD306, USS Paul Hamilton DD307, USS Stoddart DD302, USS Thompson DD305.</li> </ul> <p>Ships were navigating with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning">dead reckoning</a>, but were also experimenting with the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_finding">radio direction finding (RDF)</a> technology. This system used a number of shore-based stations in tandem with ships to provide a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(angle)">Line of Bearing (LOB)</a>. It had some flaws, but was valuable in poor visibility.</p>
<p>Visibility was worsening as the ships steamed south. Dead reckoning and experience told the navigators they were further south, but RDF told them they were further north and near the coast. Watson decided the new technology was in error and that they were too close to San Miguel (one of the Santa Barbara channel islands) and the SS Cuba, which had ran aground there. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_operating_procedure">SOP</a> had ships in columns, with 250 yards (228.6 m) from foremast to foremast, which mandated they overdrive their braking capabilities. Traveling at 11 yards/sec (10.0 m/s, 22.5 mph, 36.2 km/h, 19.5 knots) means they covered this gap in 22.7 seconds.</p> <ul>
	<li>2100 - Watson orders ships turn to port (left) at 095 degrees, turning due east and closing on shore.</li>
	<li>2105 - USS Young crashes a submerged reef, spins starboard (left, north), and gets stuck on the reef.</li>
	<li>USS Delphy glides on gravel before crashing. Most captains had realized the Delphy was aground.</li>
<li>USS SP Lee sees Delphy crash, and the captain turned port (right, south) in a panic, but only found more coastline and went aground.</li>
<li>USS Nicholas also goes to port (right, south) and makes her propeller touch bottom before going aground.</li>
<li>USS Woodbury was behind the USS Young and made evasive maneuvers to starboard (left, north) and came aground on a rock that was named after it.</li>
<li>USS Farragut saw what was going on, and ordered full reverse, which badly damaged the boilers and generators. </li>
<li>USS Fuller didn't see it and crashed into USS Farragut.</li>
<li>USS Summers also hit its propellers on the bottom but managed to get away.</li>
<li>USS Chauncy gets too close to USS Young to get survivors, and Young's propellers cut through Chauncy's hull, damaging Chauncy's engines.</li> </ul> <p>Railroad section leader John Gurvis finds the boats from the nearby rail line, and tells them they weren't on the channel islands, but much more north on Honda Point (aka the Devil's Jaw). They hadn't overshot their turn, but vastly undershot it, partially due to unfelt currents pushing the fleet closer to shore. These ships reported their speed from propeller turns, and speed is an important component for dead reckoning math. Each wave pushed propellers up and sometimes out of the water, so they were really going much slower than was reported on ship instruments. By the time the sailors had climbed the cliff to see where they were, John Gurvis had gone inside and called for rescue on his landline telephone. Watson was startled by the sound of a railroad train, as he thought he was on an island, and only then did he realize just how far off course he'd led the squadron.</p></td></tr>

(Were it actually spinning, it would have to spin many times the speed of light to create this level of magnetic charge. This phenomenon will be referred to as Polarity for macroscopic clarity.) Polarity allows two like particles to "stack", thus explaining why electrons "orbit" in pairs.

This presented a new puzzle, as a material with this high of density <strong>and</strong> the compressibility of a perfect gas can happen only at temperatures high enough to completely ionize all atoms in the core, to form an aggregate of matter very different from found on Earth. An ionized gas is made of "naked" atoms - denuded of their electrons - and being millions of times smaller than normal atoms allows them to be unbelievably densely packed.

Hot valves reduce how much you can compress a fuel without it predetonating, and increases chance of backfire. This process also pulls out the last bit of exhaust from the previous ignition, so the next ignition has more clean air and thus is more powerful. With carburetion, air and fuel are already mixed, so this wastes a small amount of fuel. But with fuel injection, you can time the injection to just after the exhaust valves have closed, wasting none of the fuel - which can be more volatile <strong>and</strong> compressed more because of the cooler exhaust valves, both giving more energy. This led the Ricardo company (UK airplane makers) to start experimenting with fuel injection.</td></tr>

<p>Japan asked to join their club. Japan held isolationism for over 200 years, until the USA forcibly entered their ports and legitimized it with a shotgun trade deal. Japan, who have no natural resources (oil, rubber, copper, etc), were subject to a bunch of unequal treaties, busting their economy. So they invaded China to get a sphere of influence over Korea, and take their resources. But the UK, France, Germany, and Russia stopped them, because they were setting up spheres of influence across a weakend China.</p>
<p>So Japan warred against Russia and won, annexing Korea. Next, they took Germany's islands in the Pacific during WW1. Then, a bomb blew up a train in Manchuria, giving Japan an excuse to invade Russia's occupation of the area. This might have been a Japanese plot.</p>

Poles fought hard, but were no match for this double-teaming.</p>
<p>Then came the "Phony War", a period of little aggression:</p>
<p>France's Saar Offensive was easily repelled. They were still living in their WW1 victory: using horses, sending messages by motorcycle instead of radio, orders were vague, and troops were rarely inspected. They built the Maginot line along the German border, but not along the Belgian border nor to the channel. And they wouldn't launch artillery strikes for fear of Germany shooting back.</p>
<p>The UK's attempts were equally futile. Hoping for a diplomatic solution, the RAF flew dropped propaganda fliers instead of bombs. One air marshall said it was "likely did nothing but provide the continent with toilet paper for the duration the war." The UK only sent 200k troops to France, who had mobilized millions of troops.</p>
<p>Both the UK and France wanted to avoid a repeat of messy home fighting in WW1, so they looked to Norway. Sweden and Norway were both neutral, but iron ore from Sweden was traveling through Norway to Germany. So the Allied duo asked Sweden and Norway to stop, but were refused.</p>
<p>The Winter War - Russia invades Finland. So the Allied duo asked Sweden and Norway to allow their troops to pass, and take the iron, but were again refused. So the Allied duo mined Norway's shipping lanes, to force these shipments into international waters, where they could be intercepted. And they attacked a German tanker, the Altmark.</p>
<p>German leadership saw what the Allied duo were up to, and invaded Norway by invading Denmark, to secure the iron ore supply lines. Allied troops took the ports, but Germans took the airfields, and used air superiority to outmatch the Allies.</p>
<p>After this Chamberlain resigned, and Winston Churchill took his place.</p>
<p>German leadership's WW2 plan was similar to their WW1 plan: Attack France, knock out the UK in the process, then turn on Russia. And their armies were given all the prep time in the world.</p>
<p>Allies tried to put troops in Belgium, but were refused, so Germany invaded easily. After this, Allies invaded the German invasion, and it looked like a repeat of WW1. But Germany had a trick: Blitzkrieg, sending thousands of refugees westward into Allied troops.</p>
<p>France had considered the hilly and forested Ardennes as naturally impenetrable, and lightly defended. But Germany smashed 50 Wermacht divisions through, encircling Allied troops, decimating the French and forcing the UK to leave the continent through Dunkirk. After this, Paris and the rest of France fell easily.</p>
<p>The UK were expected to fall easily after this and sue for peace, but did not. So Germany tried Mind Games, but they were not very effective. Italy declared war, to remind the UK that they were alone (a new Continenal system?) A French puppet state was left in operation, to make it seem like France and her people were happily living under German rule. Further, all 3 had colonies in Africa, and Germany were hoping their new French holdings would be ignored by UK forces - but Churchill upended that by having ships sail to Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria, and wreck boats.</p>
<p>Next was air superiority over the English Channel. RAF fought bravely but were overrun by superior numbers.The Luftwaffe attacked UK ports, then RAF bases, wrecking UK air defense. Churchill ordered a small bombing run over Berlin as a response - it wasn't militarily impactful but made German leadership furious. Bombing runs directly on London were ordered, and British kids were sent to the countryside to remain safe. Air raid trips became daily occurrences for those who stayed, but they took it in stride - smiling, knitting, lounging.</p>
<p>By focusing on London, Luftwaffe gave RAF bases time to recover. This led to the RAF defeating Luftwaffe forces in a final raid over London, where many Luftwaffe planes were shot down. UK had retaken air superioity over the English Channel, postponing a German invasion, but not preventing further bombing.</p> </td></tr>

Torpedo nets showed the torpedo aimed to hit 10 feet (3 meters) under the surface for a submarine, actually hit the net at 25 feet (7.6 meters) under the surface, where only heavy battleships would be hit. The average difference between setting and reality was 11 feet (3.35 meters). Word of this got to (a supposedly notorious) Admiral King, who consulted the Bureau of Ordinance, after which they admitted the issues were known and testing was flawed. The Bureau of Ordinance had used very light dummy warheads, so the torpedoes would float after testing and be easy to collect. This meant they had to calibrate the torpedoes to aim much lower than with the heavier live warheads. The warhead was increased after this, and the depth sensors were installed in an area that would give false readings, causing the torpedo to go even lower. The depth sensor was a tricky one, since it was installed where the torpedo's shape causes a vortex as it moves through the water, which isn't detectable in a currentless bathtub. Now, torpedoes consistently either explode too early, or do not explode. Some did still damage their targets, but not into sinking.</td></tr>

(Japanese whale uninstallers would be bringing whale oil home as fuel for their war efforts.) Drop testing after this showed that angle hits were much more likely to trick the faulty contact detonators into firing, than direct hits. Ships were ordered to ignore their training and fire torpedoes at an angle, which gave a slight improvement in detonations. Further testing and deconstruction revealed the contact detonator's fire pin was 90 degrees from the direction of travel - if it were in the plane of travel, the impact would help it fire, but this way impact helped it jam. Often the torpedo's collision would smash its contact detonator before it could fire. Angled impacts gave slightly longer and slower impact, damaging the fragile detonator less and putting the line of travel closer to the firing pin's line of movement. This design flaw was in the previous generation, which traveled much slower, but the Bureau of Ordinance believed the same solution - a stronger spring - would continue to work with the faster torpedo. There was an additional issue common to all torpedoes, where a gyroscope might flip, causing the torpedo to flip and chase the ship which fired it - this caused at least 2 Allied ship losses during WW2.</td></tr>

<p>It was being recklessly overused as a floating ammo storage shed at Manus Island, Paupa New Gunea, and still had 3k ton (2722 metric tons) or 75% of her ammo load from Virginia. Sailor David Greenroose (USA) (16 yo) was serving on the ship, and had counted 400 ships in the harbor on busy days, as it served as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staging_area">staging area</a> for the US invasion of Japan. Greenroose recalled that while the ship flew the "E" ammunition flag, it was illegally parked: US Navy regulations said an ammunition ship had to be anchored several thousand feet from other ships, not docked next to them.</p>
<p>Storage practices were lax, with explosives stored next to detonators, incendiaries stored in a wood and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_paper">tar paper</a> hut, and several damaged rockets whose propellant was badly leaking onto a storeroom floor. Proper explosive handling techniques weren't taught and safety notices weren't posted. Non-smoking areas around the ship weren't enforced.</p>
<p>The 3 kiloton (12.552 TJ) blast lowered the 35 ft (10.7 m) harbor by another 50 ft (15.25 m) across a 200 ft x 1000 ft (61 m x 305 m) area, in which was found the largest piece of ship, just 10 ft x 16 ft (3 m x 4.8 m).

The 350 sailors whose remains were entirely vaporized in the blast were recorded as Missing In Action (MIA) instead of uninstalled, as there were no remains. Instead of blaming the uninstalled, Admiral Nimitz excused the technical errors and lack of procedure following on the "keen desire to meet necessary military commitments" and that war would always invole certain operational hazards.</p></td></tr>

<p>From the start, some veterans had trouble securing the GI Bill’s benefits. Some could not access benefits because they had not been given an honorable discharge—and a correlation of dishonorable discharge and increasing skin pigmentation, as though there were an irrational obsession with punishing people for producing high amounts of melanin.</p>
<p>The GI Bill created a massive influx of students, and institutions reacted to this glut in different ways. Southern colleges simply refused to matriculate any students who generated too much melanin, while Northern universities focused on low-melanin students. 95% of high-melanin veterans were shunted off to mostly-unaccredited Black colleges where they would compete for the few availabilities with students fresh from high school. The VA addressed this educational inequality by encouraging veterans to apply for vocational training instead of university admission, and arbitrarily denied educational benefits to some students. Vocational training programs were impacted by the same segregational policies as the rest of the education system, further limiting the learning opportunities for these individuals. Black veterans and civil rights groups protested their treatment, calling for protections like Black involvement in the VA and non-discriminatory loans, but the racial disparities in the implementation of the GI Bill had already been set into motion.</p>
<p>Of the more than 3,200 VA-guaranteed home loans across 13 Mississippi cities, banks turned away an estimated 318 customers purely due to their skin pigmentation. This afinancial nonsense wasn't limited to the South, notes historian Ira Katznelson, as in New York and northern New Jersey, banks again turned away an estimated 6,600 customers purely based on pigmentation. This forced these veterans to remain in cities that received less and less investment from businesses and banks. This was possible because the Veteran's Administration (VA) didn't have the funds to provide these loans, and so acted as cosigner on local bank loans. This allowed local banks to coordinate Redlining—a decades-old practice of marking maps by skin pigmentation or ancestry, to characterize the risks of lending money and providing insurance, thereby reducing the available housing supply to that group. Lenders banned customers from poorer neighborhoods, ensuring that they couldn't receive this goernment assistance. And new suburbs often came with overtly racist covenants that denied entry to people based on their pigmentation.</p>
<p>New businesses sprouted around these suburbs, and they hired and served mostly local people. This local suninstalled labor allowed workers to collect large amounts of assets - and due to Redlining, almost all of these local workers and customers had pale or pink pigmentation. Long-term asset collection was largely blocked for people with darker pigmentation.</p>
<p>Some veterans seeking the education they had been guaranteed were at a considerable disadvantage - generational discrimination prevented their parents from having the incomes to properly fund public schools, meaning additional college prep was often needed to reach the level of education provided by well-funded public high schools. And there was a lot of social and cultural pressure to forego public education and enter the workforce as a courier of illegal goods. </p>
<p>Southern postmasters were even accused of refusing to deliver the forms veterans needed to fill out to receive their benefits.</p>
<p>"Though Congress granted all soldiers the same benefits theoretically," writes historian Hilary Herbold, "the segregationist principles of almost every institution of higher learning effectively disbarred a huge proportion of Black veterans from earning a college degree."</p>

The government’s case accused the studios of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act in their total control over movie distribution and exhibition, and demanded that the studios end block booking, and get rid of either their distribution arms or theaters. By the terms of the verdict, the studios were made to sign consent decrees that would end the practice of block booking by requiring that all films be sold on an individual basis. They were also required to divest themselves of their own theater chains. With this decision, independent producers could finally begin to compete with the major studios for audiences and actors, marking the beginning of the end for the Hollywood studio system.</td></tr>

This was improbable with the 120 mm (4.72 in) Centurion gun currently in use. The projectile for the 183 mm (7.2 inch) gun was 160 lbs (72.6 kg) and the propellant charge was another 73 lbs (33.1 kg), so a loading system put the bullet in place to be pushed in by the operator. Other tanks had full autoloaders, unlike this partial loader. The final design was called FV4005 Stage 2 and only 2 were produced, with a large and boxy turret that was only armored against artillery fragments and not intended for the front lines. Just 12 rounds of ammo could fit inside, adding 2800 lbs (1270 kg) and it was planned to have frequent supply refills. Tank Destroyer tanks, and their unrealistically-oversized cannons, were replaced by larger missiles, mostly air-to-surface.</td></tr>

	<li>No tankers to refuel them, obviating defenseless tankers and costly escorts.</li>
	<li>Maintain max speed for extended periods. They couldn't go any faster than diesel ships, but they could keep that speed far longer. This speed advantage would grant a type of protection for a few years, until other world powers got equivalent technology. (There are Klingons off the starboard bow? Super Runaway!)</li>
	<li>Much quieter than diesel engines, with submarines able operate silently underwater for months, while diesel submarine batteries last days or less underwater.</li> </ol> And some downsides: <ul>
	<li>Cost much more to build or buy, and crew because the 2 reactors require so many nuclear engineers.</li>
	<li>Multiplying these costs, Adm Hyman G.Rickover, chief of the US Navy's nuclear program for decades, required intensive training of engineers.</li>
	<li>Civilian use of nuclear power was expanding rapidly, leading to continual headcount attrition to civil nuclear reactors.</li>
	<li>Every refuel was also an expensive refit, because the reactor is built into the ship and servicing it (often more to remove the xenon nuclear poison than to add uranium) requires cutting a big hole in the ship's armor.</li>

Savannah Story'>(2022) YT: Mustard - Nuclear Ship</a></td><td><p>NS is Nuclear Ship, which used Uranium-235 to fuel a steam boiler. A typical ship will burn through 20k barrels (840k gallons or 3.2 million liters) of bunker fuel on 1 geocircular trip, but Savannah's goal was to prove the viability of nuclear-steam as a ship powerplant. Over the next year, it would travel 150k km (93k mi or 0.001 AU) to 32 US American and European ports, using just 35 lbs (15.9 kg) of Uranium-235. Huge crowds met the ship at every port, with 1.4 million tourists passing onboard. After this year voyage, the passenger area was converted into more cargo area, and it hauled for 5 more years.</p>
<p>The nuclear-steam reactor was shielded, inside a heavy steel chamber, and had another 500k tons of shielding between the reactor and passenger cabins. (Hard to have 500k tons of shielding when total displacement is 21.8k tons.) Had one-way valves to allow seawater to enter and cool the reactor. (Where would the gases go? Sounds like a recipe for a hydrogen pressure-explosion, just like Fukushima.)</p>
Nontrivial to operate:<ul>
<li>60x passenger area reduces cargo area by about 25%, and high sides impede cargo loading.</li>
<li>Dual-function and nuclear both increase crew count to 1/3 more than other ships of the same size.</li>
<li>Special permission months in advance foreach port, with frequent denials.</li>
<li>Concerns over nuclear energy safety, radiation exposure, and liability.</li>
<li>No refueling nor maintenance facilities (would conventional facilities take them, even for standard repairs, given radiation fears?)</li>

Walter Cronkite's <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050072/">The Twentieth Century</a> sold active service with the same glamor as WW2 liberators, and Ehrhart had expectations of being showered with flowers and kisses. But he was largely ignored. The strong aromatic tropical bouquet overwhelmed his delicate North American olfaction. One of his first jobs involved questioning Viet Cong [Vietnamese community] detainees, whom the Marines would toss bound hand-and-foot off tall flatbed trucks, breaking their bodies and Ehrhart's misunderstanding of the reality of the war.</p>
<p>The Viet Cong micropower's snipers and mines had a brutal psychological impact on US American soldiers - having no visible enemy to fight, the soldier would call an airstrike on whole villages - and this would radicalize any survivors into more Viet Cong soldiers. Ehrhart was taught in US American high school that Viet Cong leadership were brutal dictators who forced friendly Vietnamese to fight the US Americans, but a few days in Vietnam taught him that high school was wrong. And too US American soldiers were losing friends and battle buddies every day, with only the local villagers present to receive their anger, leading a viscious cycle of more villages bombed and more Viet Cong soldiers to snipe more US American soldiers.</p>
<p>But none of this was clear in the moment, clouded by the emotional jungle, and young Ehrhart's lack of political savvy while deployed - he came to understand the above only years later, after learning the Vietnam War's political background. While in Vietnam, all Ehrhart could understand was that this insanity wouldn't end, no matter how hard he fought. The constant terror of being uninstalled by sniper wore down his heart and mind until he could only focus on keeping himself alive, which is one of the curses of war. (The USA lost the Vietnam War because we lost even our own soldiers' hearts and minds.)</p>
<p>Adding to the surreality of it all, Ehrhart's subscription to Time magazine was delivered to him in Vietnam. He would read what President Johnson and his advisors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Rusk">Dean Rusk</a> said about the war, which had no connection to the war Ehrhart was fighting. One example involves USA soldiers finding a Viet Cong weapons cache, which Stars and Stripes reported as setting Viet Cong plans back 4 months - but Ehrhart heard about numerous subseuqent Viet Cong attacks that Stars and Stripes did not report, showing Viet Cong soldiers were hardly set back at all.</p>

By then, CORONA satellites were regularly launched to collect thousands of images worldwide each year, and although its imagery was less timely and of poorer resolution than that from the A-12 and SR-71, CORONA was safe from anti-aircraft missiles and much less provocative than aircraft overflights. This A-12 was the first of the operational fleet to be certified to fly at Mach 3, and during its lifetime, it logged 453 hours on 232 test and training flights.</td></tr>

In fact, the IBM 5100 was extraordinarily close to becoming the world’s very first Personal Computer, a title taken a few short months earlier by the Altair 8800.</p>
<p> But the IBM 5100 contained a hidden feature - at a time when most computers could only support the BASIC programming language, the IBM 5100 had the ability to emulate programs in both BASIC for system/3 and APL for system/370. (The "system" in this case refers to IBM mainframes). According to Bob Dubke, one of the IBM 5100 engineers, this function was hidden "because of worries about how (IBM’s) competition might use it." Even if the function weren’t hidden, however, the general public, especially around 2000-2001, most likely had little idea that such a machine even existed.</p>
<p> While this is only one very small part of the John Titor legend, it seems to be the genesis for the entire story. Looking at it as a narrative, without the 2038 timeout and the need for an IBM 5100, Titor would have never been sent on his mission through time. And what’s interesting is, the IBM 5100 did contain functionality that was hidden from the public.</p>

AIP stores energy as compressed air within a tank, and releases it over time to drive electric motors to power electric ship propulsion motors - or sometimes drive the ship propulsion directly at low speeds (under 10 knots). This allows the batteries in diesel submarines to be used less often, meaning the sub doesn't need to surface and run the diesel engines to charge its batteries as often. In the 1950s, AIP was used to increase speed, but in the 1980s it was used to increase stealth, as it extends the submerged duration from a couple days to a couple weeks. AIP *can* charge batteries, but the batteries have much more capacity - and since it's also a battery, it's more effiicient to just drive a generator.

This put Eldar in full control of the ailerons, and thus the banking roll of the airplane. Meanwhile, the autopilot managed the speed, pitch, and yaw, keeping the plane airborne. Kudrinsky and Makarov were expecting a loud autopilot-disable sound common in USSR-built planes, which was absent from this French model, so they were unaware that Eldar had some input into the plane's flight.</li>
<li>12:50 am - The plane started banking under Eldar's unwitting pressure to the right. Eldar told the flight crew, who watched the navigation display from behind the seats, and discussed in confusion how the autopilot was banking into holding pattern. Quickly, the banking turn became steep enough to pull passengers deep into their seats, and everyone in the cockpit were pulled by gravity against the cockpit's right wall - except Eldar in the captain's seat.</li>
<li>12:54 am - The autopilot had been pulling hard down on both elevators and hard left, to keep the plane aloft - but the banking soon became steep enough to fully disable the autopilot - and now it starts beeping like they were expecting. Kudrinsky and Makarov both issue orders to young Eldar, the only person who could reach the controls.</li>
<li>12:56 - Piskaryov had climbed back into the other seat and got the plane to climb - but he overcorrects due to disorientation, and the plane climbs too sharply as Eldar and his dad Kudrinsky swap the main seat- and the two original plane commanders deal with the now-stalled engines and spinning plane.</li>
<li>12:58 - Unfortunately they did not quite have enough time-as-altitude to regain speed, and had only started to pull up when the plane hit a densely-wooded hillside about 85 km (52.8 mi) southeast of Novokuznetsk (Novo-kuz-nyesk), uninstalling all 75 onboard.</li>
</ul><p>Investigators were stunned by the children being on the flight deck, and recommendations were made to Aeroflot and the Russian Civil Aviation industry to improve safety.</p></td></tr>

<p>Identified 6 days earlier, and recognized as a hurricane 4 days earlier, US Federal agencies were initially prepared. FEMA sent food, water, and ice to Florida and Louisiana. Then a systemic failure of a Federalist system occurred. In this "pull" system, assistance has to be requested from the most-local government, through the chain of intermediate governments, and finally to the federal government. But local leaders often misestimate the local needs, bureaucracy slows the chain of intermediate governments, making federal assistance always late. This level of emergency needed a Relief Push system, where the federal government allocates resources </p>
<p>Mayor Ray Nagin (NO, USA) mandated evacuation just 24 hours (1 day) before landfall, and knowing 100k residents didn't own cars, turned down a fleet of schoolbuses for the evacuation, saying the evacuees should have more comfortable Greyhound buses instead. Some Greyhound buses were sent, but FEMA turned them away. Ray Nagin went on the Oprah Winfrey show, and claimed that "hooligans" were pillaging and involuntarily mating with the refugees - this actually hampered relief efforts as they focused on security over assistance.</p>
<p>Governor Kathleen Blanco (LA, USA) requested military aid from other states at landfall, since 40% of her State's troops were in Iraq, and this took another 24 hours (1 day) to approve. She threatened to send troops who had recently returned from Iraq to protect stores against looters, using their recent service to dehumanize them into legendary beings whose only desires involve uninstalling (other) humans.</p>
<p>The Superdome became a Shelter of Last Resort, taking in 9k refugees in the first day and a total of 20k-30k - but the facility had no food and little water. Amtrack were evacuating their passenger cars and offered NO (New Orleans) to let several hundred residents ride free, but NO refused and the train left empty.</p>
<p>NO Police Superintendent attempted to suspend the 2nd Amendment, saying "No one will be armed. Guns will be taken. Only law enforcement will be allowed to have guns." and had his forces try to enforce this against law-abiding people who were afraid of looters. In one case, police officers entered a resident's house unannounced and tackled the resident as she was being interviewed by a news reporter. The officers confiscated her handgun and paid her a fractured shoulder in exchange.</p>
<p>There was no DHS preparation or management - Having been established in response to terror attacks, their priority was in preventing future attacks, and hurricanes weren't recruting fighters into training camps. DHS law enforcement officers took a week to arrive and got in a turf war with DOJ law enforcement. Likewise, FEMA issued notices reminding external emergency services agencies not to respond to calls inside the area, unless local agencies requested them to do so. FEMA refused to work with aid agencies. They were removing hospital ID bracelets from patients as they were discharged (and replacing with FEMA bracelets) so hospitals lost track of numerous patients. They turned away trucks of water and prevented the US Coast Guard from delivering fuel. They didn't respond to Greyhound buses or civilian aircraft attempting to evacuate, nor a German plane of supplies. They evacuated 200 people from their homes and left them stranded on an overpass. FEMA blame poor communication, as they were impacted by cell outages and poor radios, and took 6 days to distribute satellite phones to employees.</p>
<p>1823 humans uninstalled (0.22 Covid-days) - many lived in a multi-level structure, and had moved to the uppermost floor - when floodwaters rose above the windows, they would hammer on their ceilings and roofs, trying to break through and escape the flood waters. Survivors could often hear banging on the roofs of nearby houses...which would eerily stop when floodwaters rose. And survivors further suffered the psychological horror of having to push human corpses away from their boats.</p>
<p>Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan (USA) suggested the breaking of levees in poorer parts in NO was a repeat of the 1927 Mississippi Flood tactic of flooding poorer areas to save richer ones - and was investigated by the US House, but found to be false. The flooding wasn't so much from the incredible rain as "storm surges" - a combo of low pressure and high winds, generating 27.9 ft (8.5 m) waves against the 17 ft (5.1 m) levees from the 1968 Flood Control Act. And some of the levees hadn't been constructed yet, as the project was still 10 years away from its 2015 completion. </p>
<p>For the survivors to live in, while houses were torn down and rebuilt, FEMA bought 95k mobile homes for $1.3 billion ($13,684 each, 2021 equivalent $19,535 or 76.9 GC). But only 17% (16,150) were used, for an effective cost of $80,495 each (2021 equivalent $114,911 or 1.8 GD).</p>

<p>The earthquake automatically put the active reactors in shut down mode, using power grid energy to insert the cooling rods.

The lasers trapped the atoms as if they were in a bowl measuring less than a hundred microns across. Breaking the bowl will allow the rubidium to rush out, expanding as the rubidium in the center pushes outward. To create negative mass, the researchers applied a second set of lasers that kicked the atoms back and forth and changed the way they spin.</td></tr>

<li>Stabilized World: #1 but industrial output is voluntarily turned down early, in favor of crop production. (Also developed pre-climate change.)</li>
<li>Business As Usual2: Massive industrial output causes massive pollution, heavily impacting food production, which heavily impacts population, which reduces to around 2 billion humans on Earth starting in 2040.
