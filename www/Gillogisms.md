1. 31 Jul 1970 - Black Tot Day. (Grog was a sailor's daquiri, and a daily ration was how the British Royal Navy prevented scurvy. Why a full beverage instead of just lime juice? Because 'a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down' - the same reason that the British worked a malaria treatment into a Gin and Tonic.) - 2021
1. 3D for movies is like astigmatism, especially where glasses fix it. - 2012

1. A Mealy-mouthed Internet Browbeating from a Prevaricating Wastrel. - 2024
1. A more-specific answer is just more-specific, not more-correct. A more-general answer is just less-specific, not less-correct. - 2021

1. A product's price must be an asset and a liability. An asset in communicating the value created through the purchase as well as a liability in making money by being higher than the costs. And the market window is the gap where the asset value is higher than the liability cost. - 2023
1. A reverse Hudsucker Proxy. They saw a Portrait of Dorian Grey not as a horror story, but as an instruction manual. Have kids, put them in front of the portrait, and live forever. Use your chance, your second chance, and have kids so you can use their second chance also. - 2020
1. A single administrator, hosting a single application on a single server, for a small user base, can give 3 nines easily. And 3 nines is good enough 99.9% of the time. Moving beyond this means multiplying those nines together in an attempt to get more nines. - 2018
1. 'A society grows great when old men plant trees under which they'll never sit.' That is The Country For Old Men.

1. A through B - Wanting one thing, and the percieved way to get it is to perform an unrelated task. What you want is attention and admiration from others, and to achieve this you buy a new phone. Gaining A through perfoming A would have you talk to others and gain their admiration directly, through service or financial or other means. 'This isn't just A through B - this is like A through G.' (Is this a type of lying? It's being disingenuous about your intentions.) - 2023
1. A time for everything, and everything in its time. - 2001

1. Acting as Embelleshment: embellishing the parts of your personality that synchronize with the character's, and repressing the parts of your personality that dissonate with the character's. Thus each actor's interpretation of the character varies by the actor's own personality attributes, and the portrayal reveals as much about the actor as it does the character. 
1. Acting as The Method: Recall parts of your past that mirror the character's situation, and use your organic reactions to your past as the character's reactions to these events.
1. Actors say 'break a leg' because 'good luck' is bad luck and they want you to be 'in the cast'. - 2021 
1. Actual ETs aren't part of the psyop - they have no idea what we're doing to ourselves on Earth. - 2023
1. Adding one more unit of energy to a location costs more than one more unit of energy - the more energy is in a location, the more energy it takes to add energy to there. Energy following the path of least resistance suggests that if you put a hot potato and a cold potato into any cooking device, the cold potato will gain more heat than the hot potato, since it's cheaper for the energy to go into the cold potato. Almost like balloons of energy, where the less-inflated balloon is easier to inflate than the more-inflated balloon. - 2023
1. Admin is a Dev who Gets Stuff Done (GSD). - 2021
1. Advertisers see app and browser notifications as ATMs. - 2016
1. After 2020, we don't have plans; we have hope. We don't plan to goto the grocery store and buy toilet paper - we hope that the roads to the grocery store will be clear, hope that the grocery store will be open, and hope that toilet paper is in stock. - 2020
1. After race swapping comes Rey-swapping, with Daisey Ridley playing every MCU character at once. (Eddie Murphy did this in how many movies?) - 2022
1. Age doesn't create or bestow wisdom, rather merely creates the time-space where wisdom might grow and blossom. Like the years for a rose to grow and blossom, or become overgrown by wild plants. - 2023
1. AI researchers are relearning all of the soft sciences, as they show up again in lithographic neural networks too. - 2022

1. Al Gore didn't invent the internet, but he did invent AlGoreIthms. - 2019
1. Alcoholic beverages become both antibacterial and flammable at about 75% ABV. - 2023 (This is how flame-spitters work - they hold alcohol similar to Everclear in their mouths, then spit it over a lighter or candle.)
1. Algonym & acrogram & acrorythm (because I can't remember the word 'acronym' for some reason.) - 2008
1. All hands on deck is too many hands on deck - it's a management failure. - 2018
1. All of my excess sympathy was spent in 2023 - in this time, there is no time, for those who would take my time - gas, grass, or ass are required to pass this checkpoint. - 2024 (Not even robbing Peter to pay Paul and Mary - but robbing The Devil to pay Quark of DS9; not getting blood from a stone, but getting blood from seawater.)
1. All music today is electronic music, with acoustic music being assembled from numerous recordings of acoustic musicians. - 2019

1. Ambulance Ambiance.
1. America's 'political problem' is the Hawthorne Experiment multiplied by Ford's 'Edsel disaster'. - 2020
1. American Cheese, but from Hollywood instead of Wisconsin. - 2024
1. An autistic person has trouble creating and identifying viable Patterns of Behavior, so the person clings to the few good ones they find like a drowning person to a plank. 'Identify a novel, relevant, and interesting diagetic element in the current scene and make a timely remark about it when the conversation's word rate drops below a certain level and sufficient attention gaps appear' is a nontrivial pattern to undertake, and might take years of practice. - 2021
1. An imported maid is a foreign domestic. - 2024
1. Anatone, Bucoda, Colville, Dallesport, Elbe, Frederickson, Gilliam, Hoquiam, Ilwaco, JBLM, Kalama, Littlerock, Mossyrock, Naselle, Othello, Pahata, Quincy, Raymond, Skamania, Touchet, Uniontown, Van Zandt, Walla Walla, (no X), Yelm, Zilah. - 2021
1. Angels, devils, gods, and demons are, by definition, extraterrestrial. Possibly extradimensional. - 2022
1. Antipodal Antibody.
1. Anxiety is the sensation that your brain isn't working hard enough. A correct response to anxiety is to check that everything is okay, acknowledge the anxiety, and acknowledge that everything is okay. A few psychological tools exist to help with these tasks, and you can make your own also. - 2020
1. Any focus on arbitrary attributes (including race and gender) are de facto ad hominem attacks and automatically lose arguments. - 2023
1. Anyone can do (almost) anything, but nobody can do everything. - 2016
1. 'Anything worth doing is worth doing well' - British philosophy to put everything into your hobby, that if you're going to do it you should strive to excel. 'Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly' - American philosophy that you should do what you enjoy, regardless of personal skill level. (These philosophies are not mutually exclusive, as one can put maximal effort into something and still be garbage at it.) - Reference in progress
1. AOC is better at LOL than SBF. (She was ranked in her free time, but he was not despite playing during work such as investor calls.) - 2021
1. Archaepelogical.
1. Are there use cases for non-public CDNs, like large companies? Does Amazon/AWS use CDNs to accelerate internal proprietary content? Are the edge copies encrypted? -2022
1. Armies capture hearts and minds, starting with the hearts and minds of their troops. - 2018
1. Art Carney wasn't a carney (carnival worker/groupie). - 2018
1. Art makes you feel something. Life imitates art because life IS art, in that other life forms make us feel something - happy, sad, comforted, worried, and more. - 2018
1. As a good DM, I like to give people enough rope scale a wall or to make a hammock - about 50 feet. If they come up with a noose, it says a lot about them. - 2024 (It only takes like 4 feet of rope to make a noose, and there's not much else you can make with that little rope. In response to 'I like to give people just enough rope to hang themselves.')
1. As you grow and get older, you might suddenly have a realization or new perception of the world, and want to abruptly realign your actions to this new worldview. Don't freak out or do anything sudden - instead be gentle with the people around you who must also get used to this new you. - 2024 (Definitely don't chase the new realization around a tourist trap, as Aschenbach does in A Death In Venice.)
1. Assertive Without Dominating. 
1. Assuming Momentum implies assuming operating in a frictionless sociological vacuum. - 2023
1. At the point in a person's life they realize they've become their parent - and the spouse realizes they're not married to some PYT anymore, but the PYT's overweight and overbearing parent. - 2024 (Becoming your parent means you didn't learn from their mistakes.)
1. Atheism is usually a non-label. People don't usually identify as atheists, instead they stop going to church, and then get called this by data-mining theologians trying to check a checkbox. Instead of discussing which deity might or might not control the universe and why or why not, we'd rather debate which type of cloud hosting infrastructure is best for your website, or how much light is best for your plant. / In surveys, someone who identifies as Atheist is likely to be seen as near militaristic in enforcing their viewpoints, as there are so many antagonistic labeled-atheists online. How would the survey results have been if instead of 'atheist' you put 'amateur farmer'? / What about the belief of 'There's no way to prove it, but between a slimmed-down Simulation Hypothesis (not a giant Universe Simulator, but just the 4d surface of a 5d rock garden, and someone tends to the waves around the rocks, being the waves that constitute our physical reality) and with virtual photons (existing based on probability/time alone) there sure is room for a larger being to influence things. And there seems to be an excess of synchronicity in the universe...' See it's so much easier to tell the surveyor 'No I'm not Catholic or Buddhist or anything else.' - 2019-2023
1. Authoritarians try to figure out what other people are going to do, so the Authoritarian can tell the other people to do that, and in this way the other people are doing what the Authoritarian said - even if they were going to do that anyway. In this way the Authoritarian distorts reality to embiggen their own status at the cost of the other peoples' status - they claim that the other people would be lost without their leadership, when in reality their leadership can only ever be a waste of the other peoples' time. - 2019
1. Ayn Rand thought Don Quixote was an ideal person, to be elevated and respected, instead of a useless idealist to be mourned. - 2024

### B

1. Back in my day, we had leg races, not arms races. (Oh? When was that?)- 2023
1. Back seats are put into 2-door sports cars so insurance actuaries see '4 seat family car' instead of 'unsafe metal sled'. - Regular Car Reviews Brian
1. Back when people used to pronounce the 'U' in 'NASA', confusing it with Nassau and pronouncing them the same - the 1960s to 1990s.
1. Banks aren't just businesses - they're foundational businesses that other businesses and whole communities depend on, as a source of money. - 2023
1. Bannering - being able to see how to make something just by looking at it. From Minecraft Banners, where there are only like 6 shapes you can layer on top of each other, and only 6 layers that can be applied. And so they're an art of stacking these 6 layers. - 2017
1. Batman is a villain. He's no hero, injuring hard working people who couldn't find legal work. This is part of why vigilantism is a crime, when villains fight villains. (Also he's a selfish rich person who operates independently from an amazing villain hideout and drives the best villain car, plane, boat, blimp, or other conveyance as he desires.) - 2018
1. Battlefield 2077 happens on the other side of the planet from Cyberpunk 2077, but in the same year. - 2021
1. Be a collector of good ideas and habits. - 2014
1. Be honest with yourself. Being honest with yourself is the first step in knowing what you want - and that's the first step in getting what you want. - 2014
1. Be Long to Belong. (Hold the security to gain belongingness.) - 2022
1. Be There Now - immediate line-of-sight site-to-site teleportation. Immediately blink to anywhere you can see. - 2006 (X-Men training extends this to video cameras, enabling webcam-teleportation. Dune Spice extends this to the entire universe, the past, and the future.)
1. Before WW2, 'foreign policy' meant 'war', and instead of a Defense Department, the USA had a War Department.
1. Being an executive is much more sales than technology. - 2016
1. Being an intellectual authority means people are always trying to rage against you. - 2018
1. Being at the right place for the right reasons makes you into the right person. The right person is anyone who is there for the right reasons. - 2023 (The right person is anyone who has assembled the vocal, material, and somatic components. - 2024)
1. Being bigger than the limiting funding and beliefs that hold us back from being faithful to the Truth of who our bank accounts are. - 2023
1. Being emotional about a problem just means you're wearing the wrong hat. Exotic Solutions Architecture. - 2023
1. Being happy is part of being healthy. It's unhealthy to be unhappy most of the time, since mental health is part of a person's health. And it's difficult to make good health decisions when your decision-making organ isn't working well. - 2020
1. Being of House of Black does not make you an African American or highly melinated individual. - 2023
1. Being of House of Gay does not make you a homosexual. - 2020
1. Being the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with means that if you're always the smartest person in the room, you're going to act like a less-intelligent person over time. - 2023
1. Being the more mature, self-controlled spender in a retail situation. - 2021
1. Beren Mind (Ursa Mental) is the bear-like Mind Being.
1. Between Covid, George Floyd, and wildfire smog, 2020 was entirely about breathing. - 2020 (George Floyd was killled by government inaction on Fentanyl, not government action on his neck. - 2023)
1. Beware emotional vampires - the Huckleberry Finns and (People) of System that Mark Twain and Adam Smith respectively warned us about - the ones who would build their empire out of other people, painting their fence to help them out. Their actual goal is to dominate us and others - have us obeying their every whim while they watch. Some still use paper checks merely so other people have to wait for them in the checkout line, while others set up traps in their homes (like a sink with rusty knives, or potholders with large holes) and ask us for help, so we will injure ourselves and yell at them, and they can use this to get sympathy from others. - 2022
1. Beware those who seem to teach every subject, as most of them can't actually do anything. - 2024
1. Beyond Belief and into Understanding. - 2021 - Because the The Gambler song lyrics aren't '**Believe** when to hold 'em, believe when to show 'em, believe when to walk away, believe when to run' - but 'know' - being a gambler here is a projection of perception and understanding, not a projection of invented notions and beliefs. - 2023
1. Beyond good and evil, in that good and evil aren't equal and opposite pairs on a spectrum, but entirely independent phenomena - and a person can be both good and evil at the same time. (musings on Nietzche) - likewise, bread is simultaneously healthy and unhealthy. (This becomes a dichotomy pun on wordspace collisions.) - 2021
1. Bigger places can have higher standards **and** lower standards at the same time. - 2018
1. Bill Maher practices Kierkegaardian Centrism as Talking Out Both Sides Of His Mouth. - 2023
1. Bingo Fuel is the Aviation version of Range Anxiety. - 2019
1. Black Belt is like a BA in Fighting - a BMA or Bachelor of Martial Arts. In most major styles, earning one takes about 4 to 5 years, and similarly covers a broad array of topics - including kinetic and potential energy, physical fitness, anatomy and physiology, mindfulness, philosophy, and criminal psychology. - 2018
1. Black helicopters seem like they're louder than normal helicopters because they usually fly lower than civilian FAA radar systems can detect. Literally 'flying under the radar' and the major revealing element of the UFO conspiracy is that most UFOs *don't* fly below the radar, but instead within the radar. This might help discern which UFOs are part of the conspiracy and which are operated by ETs who don't care about our human classified information system. - 2024 (They're like Cortez and we're like Moctezuma and other Aztec leaders, letting them gain the upper hand in our societies as we try to gain weaponry from them to use against each other. Literally using our own drive to compete against us. Which sci-fi story has various ET races supporting different Earth governments, to increase terrestrial discord, to perpetuate a state of technological stagnation through prioritizing inter-species conflict over intra-species conflict? Basically, keep us divided and focused on our differences so that we can't unite and conquer them? We don't even share what we know with each other because we're too afraid of it being used against us.)
1. Black Swans to White Squalls - a spectrum of dark horse game changers. - 2023 (How to predict these? Statistically?)
1. Blaming forest fires on global warming is like blaming arson on global warming. - 2023
1. Blood transports **heat** - a job that is rarely remembered. Only muscles really create heat - bones, tendons, and nerves don't, skin might create a little - and just like an under-floor heating system, the blood moves heat from the muscles around the body to other organs. And especially to the skin for radiation, just like on the ISS. This keeps all our cells at their optimal enzymatic temperature. - 2014
1. Books can only be judged by their covers - that's how you choose which one to open.
1. Bored is a lack of intellectual stimulation while lonely is a lack of emotional stimulation. - 2023
1. Boring at any speed. - 2019
1. Boring discussion meanders about across long, polysyllabic words, and verbs which eventually converge. Action is poppy staccato sounds and direct verbs. - 2021
1. Both sides are necessary for the operation of a fully functional United States - we need a conservative business side to drive large-scale wealth generation & defense, and we need a liberal humanist side to support the workers and distribute the generated wealth across society. The vast resources (including raw dimensional space) means there will be an over abundance of both material resources __and__ populations, and so maintaining cooperation between human representations of resource is essential to finding the balance between austerity and overspending. - 2020
1. Both sides have a point and both sides make it sound more important than it really is. - 2020
1. Bougie boogie
1. Bow for arrows as a car leaf spring tensioned by a string. - 2020
1. Boycott is a voluntary siege. - 2020
1. Bread is an easy place to hide tons of sugar, salt and other unhealthy ingredients - so are soup, yogurt, cranberry sauce, and other sour and bitter foods. If you're going to 'cheat' and have a large amount of sugar and/or fat, why spread it out across a bread or soup filler? Why not focus it into a smaller number of much sweeter treats? - 
1. Britney Spears's life story - who plays her?
1. 'Brought' is the past tense of 'bring' - 'brang' is the sound a pan makes when it's thrown down the stairs. - 2003 
1. Build a better mousetrap instead of blaming the mouse. This is how 'scolding the ape' is an inferior solution these days. Instead of carrot and stick, we have volition and obviation. - 2014
1. Bullets are packet rockets. - 2021
1. Businesses want to make money in the easiest way possible, and that's almost always from investors. 'From customers' is usually one of the hardest. - 2023
1. Button Panic - When you've been operating a game or device for a while, and suddenly you forget which buttons perform which actions. - 2004
1. Buying macrons or CPUs - or modern Disney movies - you're not buying just 1, you're buying around 40 - and paying them to throw away the around 39 mistakes it took to make 1 good one. Bakeries could sell their 'mistake-rons' for a dime a dozen. (Or 'mist-acron', portmanteau of 'mistake' and 'macron'.) - 2021 (Disney regularly shows 2 dozen different test screenings to different groups, to see which one is better. This means filming and editing dozens of movies and throwing them away. - 2023)
1. By extending 'anti-Semitism' to cover unrelated topics like opinions on movies, the too-broadly named Jewish Anti-Defamation League (ADL) have made themselves into a joke where the group's actions actively defame Jewish people, to the detriment of Jewish people around Earth. Had they stayed out of unrelated topics, they could provide anti-defamation services to Jews and maybe others, but because of their excessive political action, they have lost too much respect to be taken seriously. This is yet another Current Year situation of a group providing only malassistance `bad help` to the group they purport to support - just as the ADL is anti-Semetic, GLAAD is homophobic, and the LGBTQ Task Force is anti-transsexual.
1. By interrogatory, the furnishing of information. - Unknown. (We're going to ask you some questions.)
1. ByRef vs ByVal - The latter makes a copy of the data values and works with those, while the former references (works) directly on the data. Many programming languages do not support ByRef, forcing all functions to be ByVal. This comes into play when you send a variable to a function, expecting the variable to be unchanged, but instead it returns heavily modified. - 2008, rediscovered in 2024 (1 if by land, 2 if by sea, 3 if byRef, 4 if byVal, 5 if bivalve, 6 if bivouac.)

### C

1. C-stores during inflation, when their price-gouging can't keep up and they become a cheaper alternative. - 2021
1. CAD Loss is basically a jump scare, but it makes you sad instead of startled. - 2017
1. Calculus should be taught before trigonometry. Calc is an extension of basic algebra to include infinities, but instead of continuing from basic to algebra to calculus, we force students to make huge detours through geometry and trigonometry, then to study trig-calc, which while revealing beautiful equations involving sine waves, does a disservice to most students and holds our society back by producing fewer STEM graduates. It's like making people take a trail instead of a highway - like forcing East Coast history students to walk the Oregon Trail to get to California, instead of letting them read about Oregon Trail travelers from books while riding highways or trains or planes to CA. - 2004
1. Caliban of Caladan. (Mutants of Dune) - 2018
1. Can we stop fighting WW2 already? It's as far in the past as 2112 is in the future. - 2016 (Future year updated across time.)
1. Can't spell 'solar panels' without LARP.
1. Can't spell aspartame without Sparta. - 2020
1. Can't spell constable without stab.
1. Can't spell conventional without convent.
1. Can't spell dungeon without dung.
1. Can't spell inevitable without Evita. (Don't cry for me, Argentina.)
1. Can't spell proliferation without pro life.
1. Canadian currency is all Loonie Toonie. (CA$1 coins have a beautiful loon on them, and are thus called the 'Loonie'. Then the CA$2 continues the trend as the 'Two-nie')
1. Cannabinaut. (Exploration of Space)
1. Car dashboard symbols as automotive emoji. - 2023
1. Celebrate the historical progress we have made instead of regretting what our ancestry did. For one, Sins Of The Father aren't, as our society has almost no legal connection between two related adults. - 2023
1. Celebrate what you could do instead of regretting what you couldn't do. - 2022?
1. Celebrimboring.
1. Celebrities including Larry Fink and Jamie Lee Curtis believe in forcing homosexual and transsexual behaviors onto majority not-homosexual and not-transsexual USA population. But are completely mute about doing the same to Middle East populations, or forcing not-transsexual and not-homosexual behaviors on their own homsexual and transsexual populations. This is hypocracy at its finest. - 2023
1. Celibacy is not involuntary if you're not working on yourself. Would you go home with a genderswapped you? - 2019
1. Cellulose is Polyglucose, being chains of sugars that bacteria like to eat. But to access one, they have to separate it from the chain, so they can only work on one at a time. - 2020
1. Character-driven story - plot points are announced and characters have turns in which their reactions are showcased.
1. Charisma as type of verbal combat.
1. Charismatic people don't need to be intelligent. Intelligent people don't need to be kind. Kind people don't need to be charismatic. The trifecta is so rare.
1. Chickadee brains (hippocampus) enlarges in winter, letting them remember better where they hid seeds and other winter meals. - Leslie the Bird Nerd (Can we do this for college tests?)
1. Children are humans with significantly less life experience than adults, along with less height and muscle mass.
1. Chinese written language is ancient emoji, and typing Chinese with Pinyin is kinda like very old fashioned texting, where you had to press '66 **pause** 666' to type 'hi'
1. Chivalry lay in the eye of the beholder. - 2017
1. Choate Cohort - 2020
1. 'Choke up on the bat' but more like Ozzy Ozborne than a baseball player. - 2024
1. Church is a word not unlike Wealth or Power, whose myriad meanings appear to grant huge agency in human minds, by obfuscating numerous concepts into one. 'Church' means both 'temple' and 'religion' at the same time, while also meaning neither of those, and both other things and not other things. 'Catholic Church' can mean a temple, congregation, priest, parish (congregation + priest), bishop (regional manager for priests), diocese (region covered by a bishop - or archdiocese is a large diocese whose bishop is called an archbishop), Vatican City, the College of Bishops, The Pope, and all of the above. Part of this is because religions were the original megacorporation, and in some legends (WH40k) remain the only megacorps. - 2021
1. Cities in the USA are incorporated similar to businesses. Both need to buy their land from the county or State. - 2021
1. Citizen Kane (1941) was a troll-movie. He whispers his last word, and we spend the whole movie reviewing his life, going over every part in fine detail, to try and figure out what he meant. Scholar. Journalist. Tycoon. Then at the end we learn it was the brand name on his old sled that he saw on the shelf as he passed. It wasn't some deep, sublime message from someone perched on the precipice of The Beyond and able to see into it and communicate back to us in the living realm - it was the last action of an enfeebled biological neural network, struggling to find 2 neurons that still share a synapse. - 2024
1. Claiming that everyone of a certain race is racist absolves the individual's own racism, in their eyes, while revealing it to everyone else. - 2023
1. Classes are pets in the cattle/pets model. Originally with software classes but seems to extend to social classes too. (What are the cattle by comparison?) - 2021
1. Classified facilities are dangerous because they're also classified from civilian regulators and inspectors, such as health and building inspectors. - 2023
1. Close your mouth when you chew on your words. - 2020
1. Coindice (d2) should not have flat edges and should not be a flat cylinder. Ideal currency are extremely short cylinders, and thus have 3 sides. The coindice's sides should be triangular to prevent landing on the edge - giving it 4 sides, where the coin's center of gravity is outside the coin for 2 of them. The easiest way to do this is to sharpen a coin, but beware the weaponization of sharpened currency. This makes a d6 modulus 2 superior to a coin-shaped object as a d2. - 2021
1. Collect the Problems You Want To Have. - 2018
1. Comedy means it has a happy ending. (Life is a comedy, not a tragedy.)
1. Commodity comorbidity. (Like diabetes and arterial buildup.)
1. Community is a portmanteau of commune and unity. - 2021
1. Compare and contrast Teslaquila with Fallout 76 Tequila. - 2020
1. Conntrails and chemtrails are easy to tell apart. Conntrails are short and follow the plane - and are always a color gradient of pale fading into blue, as plane wing cavitation causes momentary clouds which quickly fade. Chemtrails are long and always a solid pale color and not a gradient, they're tiny particles sprayed into the air. The declassified purpose for chemtrails is to create cloud cover, reducing temperature over metro areas during daylight hours. In smaller metro areas, the pilots might not have full canisters, so the chemtrails in the sky have odd bulges and gaps where the canister sputtered and ran out, or 2 trails where canisters were swapped. Liberal areas seem to exclusively have chemtrails, so liberals might not have ever seen conntrails, leading them to misunderstand how long a 'cloud wake' would last. - 2023 - (The group coordinating this also informs meterologists in some way, leading to more accurate weather predictions. Because it's easier to prognosticate when you're making things happen.)
1. Conservation of Energy isn't some sublime cosmic force driving or challenging the change of energy, but merely not having any other function to operate on that value. Similar to how values in a database or the pages in a book remain the same simply because no human/plant/animial/fungus/cosmic ray has modified its state. - 2018
1. Conservative and liberal extremists, and incels and some feminists - at the very extremes, are the same people: hateful of everyone and everything, because they hate themselves. So they take this out on the world around them, trying to 'share the love' they feel, and burn something or everything down with their rage. - 2020 (The author has since learned that this is called Horseshoe Theory.)
1. Conviction without browbeating. - 2023
1. Corruption in government is like rust in iron. Political agency (aka power) corrupts, and political agency is magnetic to the corruptible (Frank Herbert), so political agency should goto those most resistant to corruption. Oxygen rusts, as oxygen is magnetic to rust-prone iron. Power is like oxygen but not every leader is like iron, taking bribes before its term even starts. Some are like cobalt, pitting 2 corruptive influences against each other so neither gets the upper hand over it.
1. Cosplay - Superheroes etc are basically 120% humans. This is to say that if you ask any human to be Batman, that person will give you about 80% of what Batman can do. Cosplayers start their 80% by looking like the hero. - 2016 (Someone like the author would start with the gadgets, while others might start with the physical training, or maybe the detective skills and criminology.)
1. CPU speed not as ability to push out graphics frames, but ability to slice up a mile into 528,000 chunks. - 2018
1. Cracking an egg is introducing a failure mode into the shell. - 2021
1. Creating chaos is a way for powerless people to control a situation. - (Unsure if this is my own or someone else's.) - Because the powerless people can control where they create chaos, and instead of giving other power to these people, it robs the empowered of their potency. So the formerly powerless and formerly empowered gain equal control over the chaos-ruled situation.
1. Critical Race Theory and Reparations - we can't repay harms conducted against a specific race, if races are a social construct. We could still repay specific lineages for the crimes perpetrated against their ancestry. But a type of reparations are already being paid, through increased use of social safety nets by lineages thus disadvantaged, in a way so socially equal that it sickens Both Sides. - 2019
1. Crow is best served with corn & cubed carrots, and mashed potatoes. - 2024 (From someone who's eaten quite a bit.)
1. Cryptocurrencies all have massive roller-coaster-like inflations and deflations, which make them terrible as both daily use currency and as a store of wealth. They're only useful as a way to transfer wealth from funded gullible people to rich amoral people. - 2020
1. Cultivate relationships with people who are better than yourself, and learn how to become their equals. - 2017 (Always Be Upgrading)
1. Currencies are (almost) ideal gases and prices are basically temperatures, showing both the quantity and the velocity of money. 2022
1. Current things must end so new things can begin. Good things ending is the price we must pay for bad things also ending. - 2016
1. 'Current Year' is an era approximately from 2018 to 2024, lining up nearly perfectly (including ramp-up) to the Marxist-derived Biden-term goal-line push to rewrite and reboot our culture with different kinds of racism and sexism than normally exist. - 2024
1. Cynicism as knowing the price of everything and the cost of nothing. Post-cynicism as knowing the cost of everything and the price of nothing. Respecting things through knowing not just their market value, but also the human and robot labor involved in constructing one, the difficulty involved in going without or getting a quick replacement, and the complications of logistics. - 2021

### D

1. Datadog are a data logging company who don't even write their own logging utilities. They use(d) Log4J and had to have all their agents patched after the hack. - 2018
1. Decision trees and pattern steps. See each action or task or as a series of quests, with each quest checkpoint being a decision tree of upgrade or downgrade options based on performance across that leg of the quest. Some of the upgrade or downgrade options are enabled and others disabled by performance. And some options enable whole other quest legs, including shortcuts and scenic routes to skip other options.
1. Declining the invitation to participate in those financial conversations and activities that lead us away from where we truly want our bank accounts to be.
1. Delusion of choice - better to get kicked in the pants or in the teeth?- 2023
1. Democracies tend to have better documentation than other political systems because they aren't 1984'ing their population.
1. Descartes didn't just say 'I think therefore I am' - across 40 pages, he wrote all of the ways in which he thinks, and all of the ways in which he is. - 2020
1. Describing a concept with too flowery or too high of language is like overseasoning a filet mignon, or putting too many layers of wrapping paper over a beautiful gift - it makes the beauty inside inacessible to most people, and sometimes completely ruins this magic.
1. Deserts (Plains) are holy because they are purified by the sun. Swamps (wetlands) are holy because they're purified by the rain. Where is purified by both rain and sun - Seattle in summer?
1. Deserts are deserted. Often arid and dusty, but most are not sandy. - 2021
1. Desire is suffering. (Buddhism) Advertising induces desire to generate economic activity, and in an extreme sense could be construed as a form of paid torture. - 2015.
1. Did ESG happen because of Remington after Sandy Hook? Cerberus had to drop Remington because they were suddenly too hot - were these principles designed to prevent that scenario in the future? - 2022 - ESG was enabled through ETFs, which gave proxy voting power for all decisions, not just the financial ones, so BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street were able to marshall proxy votes on 'unimportant' issues. - 2023
1. Didn't your momma ever tell you that life isn't fair? - 2018
1. Different destinations shift goalposts. - 2021
1. Different historical figures are supported and repressed at different times, making history itself appear to vary with the theme of the current age. - 2020
1. Digression is rambling, and saying 'but I digress' is merely acknowledgment. - 2019
1. Dirt is a mixture of oxides and detritus. - 2022
1. Disconfabulate the constabulate. - 2020 (Don't talk to cops, whose job it is to arrest people and beyond. The most important reason for encrypting your devices - is not to prevent spying - but to prevent planting of evidence. - From N-Gate in 2021. What color is a penny? Ooh, dirty copper. One of the problems hiring for a police force is separating the helpers from the murderers (cidephilacs). The latter group are drawn to the job because of the license to kill, but these brutal folk need to make a minority of the force, or none. How to filter them out? How to find the Goldilocks-like people, who don't police too little (liberal city cops ignoring crimes happening in front of them, or getting ducklings out of a drainage reservoir instead of patrolling their jurisdiction) and don't police too much (rural sherriffs illegally stalking paper carriers in their off hours, or conservative city officers shooting a fellow officers in their zeal to stop suspects in the act), but the Andy Griffith to Alex Murphy style officer who works to protect and serve his community?)
1. Discovery, as a legal process, seems to take forever because it's both recursive and iterative, foreaching through every item and expanding every subproperty. It's a branching search method to find items secured in obscurity. This is due to the adversarial nature of auditing, where the business's success is based on limiting external information, and the auditor's success is based on clawing back these limits to expose as much as possible. - 2020
1. Distance from Earth's center to the crust is a little longer than NY-Hamburg. Then from crust to space is from Hamburg to Warsawa. - 2020
1. Diversity isn't about getting 2 of every Pokemon on your creative Ark - but instead about not limiting yourself from hiring the best because of their arbitrary attributes. Somehow anti-racism turned out to be racism all along, and likewise anti-sexism turned out to be sexism wearing a dress instead of a suit. - 2023
1. Do things that don't scale, like moving fast and breaking things. - 2017
1. Do you rhyme at least some of the time? You might be a poet and not even know it. Click here to take our free test. - 2020
1. Doctor is a meaningless title, as it's shared by surgeons and charlatans alike. For many, it's a title earned decades ago and not maintained. - 2023
1. Dodge's existential issue is they only want to make muscle cars. Dodge Ram is a muscle car with an open-air trunk. - 2021
1. Dodos aren't a running joke; they're a flightless joke. - 2020
1. Dog going inside-outside-inside-outside is taking a binary random walk between a pair of equally-optimal states. Inside is too warm and boring. Outside is too cold and boring. - 2020
1. Doing a task more often allows you to do less of the task. Automate away a step each time and it will take less time, allowing you to do the quicker task more often. This moves from multiplier to dynamo, so the more you do, the less you do. - 2022
1. Doing anything is merely a matter of having the correct verbal, material, and somatic components at the correct location and time. (The somatic components may take extensive training to master, and this should always be taken into consideration - take care when identifying something as trivial.) - 2016
1. Doing something over and over again isn't the definition of insanity (Einstein quote) - but a projection of understanding of hidden variables. Such as the videogame boss where one strike - or even 10 or 100 isn't enough to slay the beast, but 1,000 might be. One person's practicing the same kick 10,000 times is another person's practicing 10,000 kicks. Smashing together 10,000 particles accelerated to 99.999% the speed of light. In this way, different perceptions shift goalposts. - 2024
1. Don't be afraid to upgrade past a person - before, knowing them made you a better person - but you've grown, and knowing them is holding you back. If we're the average of the 5 people we spend the most time with, and we're always improving. - 2016
1. Don't commit crimes, and also, don't film yourself committing crimes. - 2010
1. Don't have the whole story be character or plot driven - have individual threads be this way.
1. 'Don't hit women' is sexist. Don't hit people - unless in self defense or emergency defense of another, and with just enough overwhelming force that the other person does not want to return a hit and the fight is over. (One Punch Sedai)
1. Don't make a stand but make like the wind. ('Run, run away, to run away another day.') - 2023 (The author doesn't have conviction so much as disapparation.)
1. Don't project onto others, but receive from them and reflect their projection back to them. - 2021
1. Don't ruin perfection - let other people do that. - 2023
1. Don't talk **about** people, talk **TO** people. - 2015. Don't talk to people - talk to what people have done. - 2020
1. Don't write and publish in the same step. Write freely in one step, edit well in another, and publish with a mind for posterity in a third. This allows you to vent and express clearly the thoughts that you don't want to air publicly. Likewise, don't architect, develop, and administer in the same step. Architect simply, develop robustly, admin decisively, and let your natural reactions in the other 2 make you better at each.
1. Dopamine is a hell of a drug. [Dopamine activates neurons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKkUtrL6B18), while serotonin deactivates neurons. Hence anxiety is too much dopamine or too little serotonin. Dopamine down-regulates serotonin, so the more pleasure you seek, the less happy you become. This chemical-backed intention becomes the delta between our happiness and our pleasure. The Kierkegaardian Finite would be serotonin, and dopamine would compliment this as the Kierkegaardian Infinite - don't get stuck chasing either pleasure or happiness, but seek to go back and forth between them. (Take weekends and vacations off. What lay in the middle of the spectrum between pleasure and happiness?) - 2020
1. Dot Product and Cross Product are two ways of combining vectors. Multiplication is a generalization of both of them, thus both the Dot ( * ) and Cross ( x ) can be used to multiply. And this becomes the 'who(m)' of basic math, a place for intellectual authoritarians to belittle the average person.
1. Double Chiller - like a Double Boiler (use a hot water bath to heat a pot of food) - but using a cold tap water bath instead, to cool instead of heat. Ice baths can be used but are usually more work than just dumping off the now-hot water and refilling the bath with cold tap water. If ice is required, you might be overextending this technique beyond what the food can handle. - 2021
1. Dr Who got back to the future the old fashioned way - [the long way around](/images/longwayround.png). - 2020
1. Draft, as the full draft in an extreme sense - show up where you're assigned: military, industrial, commercial, educational - is just another form of Communism (or maybe Facism) in Capitalist clothing. (from Invasion USA)
1. Dramatic Composition - 2020
1. Dunbar's Number cognitively drives us to 'uncare' about most people we see in life, because there are so many of us, and we can travel so far so fast. Racism is a 'lazy algorithm' for doing this, based solely on surface features. Greater emotional intelligence tells us that we ourselves aren't that way - and greater mechanical intelligence informs that this 'lazy algorithm' doesn't provide very repeatable results. Both drive a more complex algorithm based more on responses than appearances. Since this algorithm is therefore a function of either intelligence, racism becomes a lack of several types of intelligence, which explains why there are racists of every color, gender, nation, and creed, just as there are geniuses of every color, gender, nation, and creed in every scientific field. Both are intelligence-based phenomena, and the same bell-curve of intelligence occurs in all human societies at the same rate, regardless of demographic factors. - 2019

### E

1. Each Button Only Works Once. - 2019
1. Each day making different mistakes, with the goal that all of the mistakes will average out into a normal life. - 2023
1. Eagles (band) are maligned because 1. they're croners and 2. they're almost impossible to license, because each artist in the band was his own company, so each song is copywritten 3-4 times, and requires 3-4 times as much paperwork to license. (Compared to KISS, which is like 1 license owner and 3 employees. Maybe they recently streamlined this? Please let the site owner know.) This keeps their music out of, like, bar scenes in movies. So their haters still hate them, but they don't really pick up new fans, and their old fans move on. Overlicensing sorta killed their brand. - 2020
1. Earthbound: A cosmic force (gravity) binds us to Earth, and we must pay an enormous (energy) debt to this cosmic force to buy our liberation. 'We are altering your Earthbound property. You are no longer Earthbound.' - 2020
1. Easier = faster and less complex - 2023
1. Economics professors belittle young adults for spending more than older adults. Young adults do this because they haven't had as much lifetime to develop useful skills, such as cooking or auto repair, and so must pay for others to perform these services. But the same economics professor who just taught you about both utility and economic value, fails to connect these with the economic value of such utility skills. This is often cited for the field of Economics historically ignoring the economic value provided by wives and mothers, as Adam Smith was supposedly still depending on his mother in some capacity when he wrote The Wealth Of Nations. And Walden's Pond wasn't Thoreau's property, but his mother's. This leads into Matriarch Theory, that behind every Great Man is a Good Woman. 
1. Edges and corners are disproportionately impacted by probability. This is why river rocks are rounded. (Is this also true of graphs?)
1. Efficiency and laziness are two sides of the same coin. Great efficiency enables great laziness - if you get all your work done early then you can take a break until everyone else catches up. Or be Napoleon/Caesar and do the extra credit too, getting that A++. - 2023
1. Either free markets are true and at least **some** consumption within them can be ethical - the consumption of my services is ethical - or free markets are false and we're all slaves to board room decisions. - 2020
1. Electrical devices utilize Watts of energy, by consuming Volt-Amps of electricity. Watts are mechancal energy while Volt-Amps are electrical energy, and despite them being equal in most situations, electrity (power) companies techincally supply Volt-Amps, not Watts. Volts are units of electrical 'pressure' and Amps are units of physical electrons, not unlike water pressure and water volume or flow - 15 Amps at 120 Volts like a 15 gallon reservoir at 120 PSI, and it has that pressure until the reservoir is depleted. Not unlike Super Soaker air-pressure water guns. (Named after James Watt, Alessandro Volta, and AndrΓö£ΓîÉ-Marie AmpΓö£┬┐re respectively, for their immense contributions to our understanding of these intangible materials.) - 2024
1. Electrodynamocles - 2023
1. Electronics make air conditioning mandatory, or condensation can cause short-circuits. The humans working with the electronics benefit from the A/C like an office plant benefits from the light that workers need to see. - 2019
1. Emotional physics of social constellations. Be a better Jupiter in their social constellation. - 2016
1. Emotions prevent most people from acting rationally toward or against groups intersecting their prejudices. - 2021
1. Empathy is only hard if you're scared to risk being wrong. - 2023
1. 'Enchanted' is a DM's 'get out of reality free' card.
1. Engage the Expectation of Missing Out.
1. Enjoy it while you can. - 2023
1. Ensalottery - is the salad any good?
1. Entrepreneurship as yourself, your friends, and your bag of side hustles. - 2021
1. Entropy per unit of space 
1. Equal force and force escalation and political power and power creep. - 2022
1. Equinimius - 2021
1. Error-Driven Development - basically Testing-Driven Development without writing any tests. Write LGTM, execute, and use the errors as a punch list. - 2018
1. ESG sucks because it doesn't make money. ESG that makes money - that's just good business, not ESG. - 2023
1. Esteban Pescayuda - 2023
1. Even if you're married, you still need to get consent every time. - 2018 - How enthusiastic does the consent have to be? Does a contract need to be signed beforehand, along with full enthusiasm? Or is everything fair game until a safe word is used? - 2024
1. Event-driven story - World events are ongoing and characters exist among them.
1. Everyone is a different person with other people (is that true?) and some people like who they are around others more than they like who they are alone. Others like their alone self more than their companion self. There are things you do when you are alone that you'd never do around another human. Specific companions may allow a person to be their alone self while with the other person, which may be liberating or suffocating, depending on the previous preferences. And some people like who they are, when they are around you. When guys want to 'get away from the women' and 'hang out with the guys' what we want to get away from is how we act and feel around women.
1. Everyone is looking for validation - in what way does this person want to be validated?
1. Everyone on the Internet has an agenda. And if you don't, one will be assigned to you. - 2020
1. Everything is either a blocker you use to prevent yourself from doing something you don't want to do, or it's yet another achievement you earn on the quest path. If you want it bad enough, you'll find a way, or (uninstall) of old age while you're looking for one. - 2014. (Like Einstein did with the Theory of Everything.)
1. Evil - self-centered, uncaring of others, narcissistic. - 2020
1. Ex peril ment - 2020 (Putting the 'peril' in 'experiment'.)
1. External validation - people are paying other people crazy amounts of money to get your attention. Make them pay **you** for your attention. - 2020 (This is A through B, or further. - 2024)
1. Extraterrestrials as the new Gods of the Gap (in our understanding).
1. Extreme reduction without disingenuity. - 2024
1. Extremely loud and incredibly slow (Why is your car?) - 2020
1. Eyepatch of Odin over one eye, Eyepatch of Kenpatchi over the other, only by the Prescient Memory of Spice do I see. - 2018

### F

1. F Murray Abraham, F Scott Fitzgerald, and 'eff' this (person/place/thing). - 2016
1. Fahrenheit and Celsius are 2 buildings next to each other. Celsius is on a hill that's as tall as Fahrenheit's 32nd floor. There are 9 floors in Fahrenheit for every 5 floors in Celsius, and they have a weird shared basement that goes down forever. You're on the 20th floor of Celsius, looking at Fahrenheit. Which floor are you directly across from? (The 68th.) - 2019
1. Fail-safe not fail-dangerous.
1. Fam = ily (Family are those you love.) - 2020
1. Family are a primary source of belongingness. - 2023
1. Family means Forever when you're a suburban mother who's trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables instead of yell at each other. Once you're an adult, like how age is just a number, family is just a name. - 2021
1. Farming begets ideology because it lets people stop focusing on their own survival and discuss their crazy ideas instead. Prosperity begets Altruism. - 2021
1. Fast & Furious is safe, like one of those Telltale games where you can't (uninstall). It's the ultimate dissection of understanding the villain. (Or maybe Batman is?) - 2021
1. Fed-Ups - The Package Handlers. - 2020
1. Feminism has 2 versions, feminism-as-equality vs feminism-as-superiority. The second group wants to put all men into dresses, until they realize that a lot of us would enjoy it, in one way or another. And that we look better in a skirt and heels than them, since the average man exercises frequently and the average second group member does not. - 2021
1. Ferrero could make UAP-themed Tic Tacs. They could have a little green or gray candy body inside the Tic Tac. - 2022
1. Fiduciary Duty: Are You Held to a Higher Standard? - 2019
1. Fight people by incepting jokes that they're mad that they get. - 2021
1. Fighting carbon is like throwing money to stop the wind. - 2023
1. Finding yourself in 2 steps: 1 lose yourself, and 2 move about randomly, learning your way back to what you know. -1998
1. Fireworks are more effective than silencers at hiding gunshots. So are misfiring cars, but it's nontrivial to get a fuel injected car to misfire, and impossible for an electric. - 2020
1. First Positive Wins and First Negative Loses. The '10k nos and 1 yes is still a yes' is First Positive Wins. The 'must be perfect to pass' is First Negative Loses. Sudden Death Overtime is First Positive Wins. - 2023

1. Flip the narrative to understand the characters. Flip the characters to understand the narrative. - 2022
1. Floats like a microservice, stings like a monolith. - Sparational 4 (2024)
1. Focus on mindfulness during the spring. If you feel like the only value that you can provide is by receiving, be sure to take a lot of time to meditate on specifically what you're receiving. - 2021
1. Foley folly. - 2022
1. Fomenting the foe-men. (Rabble rousers) - 2020
1. Ford cars taste like a gross smoothie. - 2020
1. Foreshortening is a way of projecting a higher-dimension object onto a lower-dimension object. Usually this is projecting a 3d object onto a 2d paper surface, but can also project a 4d or higher dimension object onto a 2d surface or 3d object, such as hypercube representations. - 2024
1. Forests are chaotic nests of floral combat. - 2020
1. Foundational elements - things you don't even think about. - 2017
1. Free speech and personal accountability are 2 sides of the same coin. It's not possible to speak freely about things without being personally responsible for your speech, and it's not possible to have personal responsibility for actions without the ability to speak freely about the responsibility. - 2023
1. 'French' once meant 'cannibal' in Islamic. - Unknown
1. French word for for 'thank you' Is the Spanish word for 'sea' followed by English word. - 2023
1. Friends aren't forever. Some friendships last just 5 minutes. - 2016
1. Friendship is Witchcraft - Jenny Nicholson
1. Full House - of Representatives. - 2018
1. Fund management is like day trading with other peoples' money. - 2023
1. Futurists never saw cars or phones because everyone just wanted a bigger train or CPU, and nobody envisioned democratizing the technology. What technologies do you see today where everyone's focused on making it bigger instead of democratizing it? - 2014 (AI in 2023)

### G

1. Game idea: You're fighting both robots and kaiju. You have to use the robots to push the kaiju back into the bay, and use the kaiju to push the robots back into the factory. But you can't do real damage to either. So you have to taunt one, run over to the other, wait for the first one to get there, and then dodge so the one hits the other instead of you. You only have 2 actions: taunt and dodge. UFOs start dropping off the occasional kaiju, then at higher levels start abducting you too. Powerups include Baked Cauliflour (gives you temporary Vegan Powers that can blow up either), Special Brownies (unlocks Special Brownie Attack which performs Couch Lock on Kaiju), and Galaga (performs Confuse on robots. It's Super Effective!) - 2022 to 2023
1. Games don't go gold anymore. They go from Alpha to Beta to Omega. - 2018
1. Gasoline is a compressible soup of flammable solvents which cleans the previous ignition residue before igniting. - 2017 Gasoline was originally used as a dry cleaning fluid for this exact reason. - 2021 (Rifftrax)
1. Gather your thoughts - on paper (or electronically, possibly as a website). - 2021
1. Geconomical - 2021
1. Gedorable - 2021
1. Gender studies doesn't actually study genders - instead it studies sexualities and expressions; psychology and sociology instead of anatomy and physiology.
1. 'Get woke go broke' aka the vast unprofitability of extreme Leftism is largely derived from a lack of marketable skills, due to the prioritization of ideology over education or experience. Often, it was used as an excuse for firing expensive experienced employees and replacing them with cheaper college-aged adults. Not even ageism so much as 'wageism'. - 2023
1. Getting old is really getting old. (Aging is becoming stale.) - 2021
1. Ghast of Christmas Past. - 2022
1. Gillie Galley - 2022
1. Global warming helps to meet Russia's existential need for a port that doesn't freeze over in winter. Their empire has largely been unable to ship goods nor move military forces during half of every year for more than 500 years. And the thawing trans-polar shipping route will create dozens of polar ports. - 2022
1. Glowing is growing. - 2022 (Plants grow when their leaves have so much light that they're practically glowing. Likewise, don't leave bread, water, or other perishable items in the sun (where it can glow) if you don't want stuff to grow in/on it.)
1. GoFundYourself
1. Good - actively benefits others. (Passive benefit, like breathable air, is largely ignored.)
1. Good actors are capable of using their facial muscles to convey emotions. - generalized from MST3k and Jenny Nicholson among others.
1. Good things come to those who wait, but there is too much of a good thing. And waiting is no guarantee that good things will come. Good things also come to those who go out and plant/gather them.
1. Governments are made out of people.
1. Grab bags are full of chaotic goods.
1. Grandma got run over by a ring gear.
1. Gravy Boat vs Gravy Train, in a one-on-one tug of war! It's water vs steel this SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY!
1. Greater Traitor
1. Grind to play, not play to win.
1. Guns are a 'nuclear solution' to minor disputes, and work as well as deterring minor border skirmishes with a full thermonuclear war. Having a gun precludes choosing lesser weaponry, partly because we're taught that the only way to use a gun is to shoot someone with it, and that this is always immediately fatal. Much of this is the marketing dichotomy of 'get them before they get you', using the 'unnamed them' to incept FUD. One of the Air Force's newest missiles doesn't explode at all - it can precision drop onto a single military target (like a foreign general leading a conflict against the USA) with minimum casualties. Likewise, we need to bring back large sticks.

### H

1. 'Hackers could use it.' - Hackers use electricity too - basing your security policy around hacking intersectionality implies a return to ascetic farming.
1. HAL 9001 certified. - 2020
1. Harry Potter is like Agatha Christie's Scooby Doo, with no Daphne, Shaggy swapped for a teenage Dr Who, and Scooby swapped for a stalwart owl. - 2023
1. Hat parties - grandest of all means goofiest of all. - 2024
1. Hatred is built from love and fear. (Anakin among others.) - 2021
1. Have a 2-minute song prepared. Or if you work at Gizmonic Institute, have a 2-minute presentation about your new invention. Or if you work at Univar Solutions, have a 2-minute safety talk. 
1. Having a kid costs as much as buying a house. - 2024
1. Having a stroke, but more like a rowing team than a hospital patient. - 2023
1. Having males be aggressive means we males will conveniently be gathered in one area (or moving slowly relative to our top speed), so when females find one, they'll find a small group, increasing their chances of finding an above-average mate.
1. Having someone to complain to - in person or online - gives you a reason to carry around your frustrations, until you can unload on them. And by then, all of your content slots are stuffed full of discontent. Without someone to complain to, the discontent quickly becomes stale and uninteresting compared to other content.
1. Hayt, your own private Duncan Idaho. (If you get this joke, please join my Dune Readers Support Group for B-52s Fans.) - 2013
1. Hearts, minds, and bellies - it's what we fight for. The order of these is open to Maslowian debate. - 2023
1. Heatlhcare only includes hospitals and doctors, but not the actual tools needed for health maintenance, which are gyms, healthy diets, and nights of good sleep. Why doesn't the HSA cover a gym membership? How do you expect me to be at optimal health if I'm not regularly excercising? Same for salads or beds. The healthcare industry is turning away almost half of their potential customer base because they are unwilling or unable to extend their product offerings to meet the demands of that half of the market. And instead, they overcharge for unncecessary services and try to invent more.
1. Heaven is a place **on Earth**. Not on Mars, Sedna, Ceres, nor Alpha Centauri, Beta Sirius, or Zeta Reticuli - Earth.
1. Here Comes The Sun is a springtime song
1. Hippie = a person so anti-authoritarian that they feel absolved from having any consideration towards others, and lampshade this by assaulting you with their overwhelming consideration for others - other than you. - 2023
1. Hiring honeypot, like Cicada 3301.
1. History has a 100 year cycle because it's just long enough that nobody can remember - almost nobody lives that long. Do all societies historically modulate around 120% of their members' average life expectancy?
1. Hobby of psychoanalyzing psychotherapists - what drives a person to study the drives of a person? What kinds of minds are interested in other kinds of minds?
1. Hollywood director has to shoot at least 50% of the movie on screen to have director credit. This is sometimes a reason for reshoots, redoing work so you don't need to share credit for it. (How much does that usually cost?)
1. Holograms as lasers diffracted by dust, shaped by ultrasonic sound waves.
1. Homeless does not mean unemployed - there are many homeless with jobs. Likewise unemployed doesn't mean homeless - lots of unemployed (and Not in the Labor Force) are living off of savings, side projects, and previously-built sources of income. But so many bleeding-hearts lump these into the same group, to maximize suffering and eyeballs on their post, video, or TV channel.
1. Homologation and Verboten are antonyms.
1. Homophobia is a fear of success.
1. Hope springs financial.
1. Hospitality coffee should be bold enough that a person enjoys their first cup, but bitter enough that they do not enjoy their second cup.
1. Hotwife is the guy being a wingman for his woman.
1. House MD TV show is the headcannon of Dr Perry Cox from Scrubs TV show - he sees himself as the dynamic House instead of his inaffable self.
1. Houses are incredibly dangerous as millions of people are injured inside them every year. (amirite)
1. How did Yehova impregnate Mary without marrying her? The scene sounds like Yehova was trying to be like Zeus and impregnate everything with legs, but wasn't nearly as sexual and thus swore it off after one time, and had all followers swear it off too. 
1. How much content moderation is done for free by users?
1. How you define yourself to one group becomes how you define yourself to other groups.
1. Hug a tree today, before a virus or something wipes them all out. - 2020 / Trees have evolved to start forest fires that they can survive, but their neighbors cannot. - 2021 / Trees produce terpenes like pinene which make humans feel relaxed, and over 90f these also produce ozone. They often grow large enough to fall over in strong winds and crush us humans and our structures and vehicles. They should be regulated like cattle. - 2022
1. Human foot shape is a parallel evolution of some dinosaurs and ETs, meaning it's a good shape for a foot. - 2022
1. Human objectivity is subjective to humans. - 2005
1. Humannoying. - 2020
1. Humans are among the most complex objects in the universe. This great complexity enables minor variations to yield great differences between us, which is maddening because we are all basically clones from imperfect cloning machines. (One of the things we imperfectly clone is the cloning machine.) - 2023
1. Humans are complex systems that iterate towards our optimal states. Like spinning tops, we quickly recover from perturbations. Mental illnesses are like imbalances in the tops, making the mentally ill spinning tops more likely to find stability in a unique pattern, and often more susceptible to perturbations than balanced tops. - 2023
1. Humans have just 1 psychological need: belongingness. - 2023
1. Humans in space would always need to be shielded from all solar UV radiation, as there's insufficient atmosphere to absorb the most harmful UV rays, and thus tanning in space is only a carcinogen and never safe. To mimic this, early sci-fi tended to use British and Scottish actors, since their island gets so little sunlight. And this developed into a trope where the 'accents of Space' are all British Commonwealth members - and some Americans.
1. Humility isn't about being humble - it's about being magnanimous and celebratory of others. - 2021
1. Hunger Games is like if The Man In High Castle had an annual Battle Royale, and this Most Dangerous Game was played as a type of Tarkin Doctrine reminder from The Joker to The Browncoats. This is literally the textbook method of How To Create Freedom Fighters - between the Stalinesque reparations and the utter brutality of Rome's Nero. Nobody who stays in any government for long is stupid enough to be this cruel and double-down on cruelty - Stalin wanted to keep non-military people alive so he could keep hurting them, while Nero wasn't concerned about long-term reparations. The Hunger Games is problematic in how cruel is its author, to design such overly unrealistic villains, and its readers must be educated on just how unrealistic it is - like an Ayn Rand novel - lest they struggle to make the world thus, and then make a name for themselves in overthrowing this new great evil. - 2024
1. Hyperloop is like an air pressure launch high-speed (100+mph (err 700+ mph hence the disaspirated design)) roller coaster, like the [Top Thrill Dragster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_j0p_0Lvao)...that runs all the way from LA to SF, and there's a return route. Both routes would be dug by Elon's Less-Interesting Company. It's like an underground version of Point to Point (extra-atmospheric airline aka terrestrial spaceline travel), especially based on the relative (lack of) air pressure of each. - 2022
1. Hypocrites make the best schadenfreude, and schadenfreude is a dish best served fresh. - 2023

### I

1. I can only be me, so I must be the best me that I can be. - 2012
1. I chose the Family Life, but the Family Life did **not** choose me.
1. I don't believe in social media anymore. (In a UFO/Santa/Easter Bunny sense.) - 2024
1. I don't have any wins to give you, but I'll share my losses with you. - 2024 (The winner is just the first loser.)
1. I don't want to watch **all** of the world burn - just the stupidest parts. Like a Burning Owl or Burning Man, this is Burning Fool. - 2023
1. I hate drawing physical letters on pulp. Every letter is a chore that I have to do before I can express my thoughts, and also a concern about what extra info is carried by that character's specific construction. It's incredibly distracting from the act of writing, much like the vagarities of construction are a distraction from the process of architecting and desigining. - 2005 (The author went paperless in college.)
1. 'I just want to punch you. I'm not attacking you so you're not allowed to be defensive unless you're an ist.' - liberals these days. - 2023
1. I pay taxes because I like to drive on roads and want to live in a world where all people can at least kinda read, and kinda know what stop signs and soup cans say. Society's morals should be based on the world in which I want to live, where morons and tycoons alike get treated like mere mortal humans. - 2004
1. I saw the greatest minds of their time staring into the sun and poking sewing needles into their eye sockets. (Issac Newton didn't just make up astrological nonsense...)
1. I want to conserve the progress that we already have.
1. 'If you can, do. If you can't, teach.' - The first half is modenist conservative thinking - exclusive to those with abiltiy, which is rooted in personal accountability. The second half is liberal postmodernist philosophy, where there's a place for everyone in the field, and those without a solid grasp of the fundamentals can still take part on the sidelines. This drives conservative wealth through providing functional solutions for a (sometimes high) fee, and liberal educators who weave their philosophies into their lessons. - 2023
1. **If you can walk to Beth's Cafe, you can eat there!** (Because you can't park along Hwy 99.) - 2014
1. I'll accompany you, not as a guard, but as a musical guest. - 2023
1. I'm looking for something unpretentious and restrained in size, with functional dimensions, and a full suite of features. - 2019 
1. I'm not a white man, but a pale male. I didn't choose my race or gender, and don't enjoy them being used against me. - 2020
1. I'm not calling you wrong - I'm calling your assumptions wrong.
1. I'm tired of Hollywood and other racists telling me that I can't see myself in characters with different arbitrary attributes, because our attributes are different. I see more of myself in Idris Elba's Heimdal (working man) than I do in Chris Hemsworth's Thor (spoiled trust fund baby) or Anthony Hopkins' Odin (rich old man). - 2023 (Thor's story is that after joyriding and crashing his hammer for the last time, his daddy puts him on probation by telling the KITT inside the hammer 'don't let him drive unless he's going somewhere noble' and is entirely unrelatable to an inaffluent non-royal like me. But hanging out at your workplace and waiting for customers to need to use your service is just basic retail/help desk.)
1. I've been godawful at video games for longer than most people have been alive. - 2015
1. I've never had Chick-Fil-A because the only thing I know about them are their politics. They're a political group to me, not a source of food. When it's lunchtime, I think of, like, Subway or Taco Bell or a local burger place - not the RNC or DNC, and likewise not Chick-Fil-A. - 2022
1. If governments want to get money from people, they first must give money to people. - 2023
1. If I control you, then I might be able to protect you. But if I control myself, then I can protect you **and** protect myself. - 2017
1. If I put these out of my sight, then they will join me and be out of my mind. - 2022
1. If it's too secret for Congress to know about, then it's too secret for my tax dollars to fund. - 2022
1. If not us, who? If not now, when? - ACA, 2008 (This cost the healthy author tens of thousands of dollars in unnecessary medical insurance or penalties.)
1. If only you had as little fear of being wrong as you do of dying. - 2020 and 2023
1. If people (in a capitalist society) don't pay (money) for it, they won't (know how much) value (to assign to) it. - 2023
1. If someone makes more than one ultimatum, does it become a multimatum? (Plural is 'ultimata'.)
1. If the deceased is someone you didn't like, they get a sonovabituary. - 2023
1. If The Force is female, does it have to wear a burkha in Iran? - 2023
1. If the product is so poorly made that a highly intelligent person needs to go through a tutorial or training course to know how to use it, it's too poorly made to be used and fails the basic usability test. - 2021
1. If there are 2 wolves fighting within you, assert dominance. Then you have 2 wolves to do your bidding. - 2017
1. If they could just research what actually feminism is. - https://imgur.com/gallery/ZZg62
1. If we make better and best into enemies, then there's no limit to what we can prevent ourselves from doing. - 2019 - In this way, ideology is idiotology. Ideals are models of the universe, and while some might be useful, sacrificing the current functional state for ideal states creates a dysfunctional state that serves nobody, endlessly consumes energy, and becomes an impossible maze. (How do you keep a fool busy? Reload page for a better answer.) - 2023
1. If you are going to be a badass, you can't half-ass it. (You can't half-ass being a badass.) - 2019 - You can't be a Daddy if you have Daddy Issues. - 2023     
1. If you can perceive the entire game board, and can choose to place your piece at any location, why wouldn't you place it at the victory location? - 2021
1. If you can't dance to the music, then the music is broken. (The Pulse Is Instructive.) - 2022
1. If you can't pay it back, pay it forward. - 2019
1. If you don't have a functional judiciary, you can't have a market economy. - Lei
1. If you don't perform your own garbage collection (variable de-init), or your language doesn't allow you to, then you'll need to deal with unresponsive periods where garbage collection is perormed. Because systems crashing due to an out of memory error are no longer an 'undocumented feature' of modern programming languages. (If you use Artifactory, your CI/CD pipeline might be offline for hours a week as it performs large artifact garbage collecion, a problem which afflicted at least one very large videogame developer.) - 2024
1. If you don't put yourself first, then nobody will and you'll be last. Cruel people of all shapes, colors, and creeds say that our compassion for ourselves is harmful to them, because it hinders their malicious plans for us. - 2023
1. If you fight battles you can't win, then you just feed the other team. - League of Legends, 2010. (In response to 'You miss all the shots you don't take' - Wayne Gretsky)
1. If you have to work a corporate job 100% in office this far into the 21st Century, then you're not an employee but an actor, and your role is to demonstrate how workers are able to collaborate and work alone in the space. This is why your accomplishments don't seem to matter and why you don't understand why they keep you around. - 2023
1. If you want photons to take a more energetic path, you have to provide other particles, which have enough energy to interact with the photon. Or have it travel long enough to probabilstically interact with itself, like the photon turning into a particle-antiparticle pair, and the antiparticle being annihilated by a nearby particle.
1. If you're bored, you're boring yourself. - 2010-ish
1. If you're going to change the world, please change it for the better. - 2014
1. If your corporate culture is so convoluted that it takes multiple hours of interviews to decide if someone is right for the job, then your hiring process is broken. If someone doesn't work out, in this State at least, you can let them go for no reason - so there isn't as much concern about a bad hire as in the EU or other places with more labor protection.
1. IGnorEd VPN
1. Illegal businesses still need to be profitable. And pay taxes, according to the IRS. These are counted as 'errors and omissions', as 'the USA is a Christian country'. - 2023
1. Imperial measurements usually allow integers in the natural world, while metric frequently requires floating point. But 'measurement authoritarians' have heard one good sales pitch for metric and embraced the 'I'm better than the rest of the planet' delusion. Like how global warming enthusiasts lie about the highly non-linear relationship between carbon and climate, metric enthusiasts lie about global adoption rates. Many areas still use their native measurements by switching to metric but having everything be like 0.8 meters. Or claim to be fully metric, but still use miles and gallons and stones. - 2023
1. In a sea of inequality, there is no peace; only calms between the storms. - 1994. See the storms as time to plan for the next calm, and the calms as time to act. (Machiavelli) No plan survives first contact - stormproof your plans with fallbacks and alternatives.
1. In gesturing you're ingesting in jest. (Hooray for nonsense) - 2018
1. India has Government Wheat through their FCI (Food Corp of India), similar to USA's Government Cheese.
1. Induced Demand implies infinite cars and that everyone drives the same speed. It ignores that if there is significant open roadway, some drivers will drive in overwhelming excess of the speed limits, while others will still follow it. So groups still bunch up going slightly over the speed limit. It's still safer than not having enough roadway capacity, which will cause stress and some excess speeding without the space to accomodate it. And why - my State isn't going to run out of agritourism land to suburbanize anytime soon. Why live on top of each other when there is so much empty space we can tend and spread across? Or should we conserve 98% of the State as National Forests, where only lumberjacks can roam?
1. Inflation is a transfer of wealth without being a transfer of money. Printing more money transfers wealth from the people who already had money to the people getting the new money. Each new dollar printed pulls a small fraction of the value represented by every existing dollar already in circulation, or your bank account. By robbing a little bit of value from each existing dollar, the value of each dollar is reduced slightly, and proportionately more of them are required to exchange for a good or service.
1. Initialize a variable by setting its initial value. - Unknown
1. Intelligence agencies are really disintelligence agencies. - 2021
1. Intelligence is not a constant - we don't always operate at our maximal intelligence. When we're sleepy, groggy, or otherwise impaired, it's like having a lower IQ. When asleep we effectively don't have an IQ. - Some video idk.
1. Intergagging - 2017
1. Internet antichivalry and counterchivailrous activities. - 2018
1. Interstate highways in the USA are public property owned by the individual State, and not by the Federal government. Same difference between a State Park and a National Park. The Federal government pays each State to maintain the interstate highways in their state. US-numbered highways are likely in the same arrangement but that older program gets less funding. - Unknown ('It's all the government's fault!' 'Which government, UN, Federal, State, County, City?')
1. Inverse mage pockets, where whatever you need is at the very bottom, and tangled up with everything else, so you have to pull everything out and detangle the mess every time, taking 10 full combat rounds (60 seconds) to get what you need. (It's the little things that make you hate life.) - 2021
1. Is 'simp' an Anglicization of 'simpatico'? - 2022
1. Is it really representation if it winds up belittling the target group? No, it's Accelerationism. Too much of Current Year's representation diminishes the target's reputation instead of embiggening it, and thus Current Year Representation is mostly problematic. - 2024
1. Is the other person / algorithm bad at knowing what we want, or are we just good at finding reasons to reject what is put in front of us? - 2018
1. Isosolated Triangulation - be like Spiderman and cling to the wall when defenestrated. - 2022 (Keep the same distance with all parties. If you suspect hidden communication between 2 parties, establish hidden communications with each.) (The author has frequently endured 'reverse triangulation' where trauma and toxic behaviors are employed not to separate similar people, but to drive together disparate people, with the goal of forcing an emotional cohort bond.)
1. It's a Brave New 1984, where we rewrite history to make ourselves happy. - 2014
1. It's a cape if it flows behind you, and a shawl if you wear it over your shoulders. - 2024
1. It's about teaching someone that they already know how to fish - and by digging in the dirt, spinning thread, fighting with sticks, drowning worms, and committing minor arson, they can also feed themselves. - 2016
1. 'It's all been done' means everything postmodern has been done - there's still tons of modernist work to be done. - 2018?
1. It's committed to memory as in committed to mental hospital, not committed to repo. - 2023
1. It's easier for other countries to put sleeper agents in the USA, than it is for the USA to put agents into other countries. This is because going from authoritarian countries to the USA is almost like a vacation, between freedom of travel and general acceptance of person. A citizen of Russia or China might volunteer to move to the USA and be a spy or sleeper agent for free. Meanwhile, convincing someone to depart our relative paradise to endure months or years in a place with bad weather and oppressive government is no easy feat, and might require huge amounts of currency. - 2023
1. It's like a road - this section of roadway only really has value because it's connected to other sections of roadway. So the other sections give this section its value. So too does my knowledge on its own only hold value to me, and has value to others only if it's contiguous to the knowledge they hold. - 2019
1. It's not that we'll make a perfect artificial neural network - just an artificial neural network that exceeds the abilities of our natural neural networks to train an artificial neural network. - 2023
1. It's said that a prerequisite for being a good pastor or minister is that the person has passed through Redemption at some point. In the same way that a good AA sponsor is/was a drinker, and preferrably a recovered alcoholic, so they know all of the places that an alcoholic might hide their alcoholism that a normie wouldn't knkow to look. Such as Sobriety Math, where they subtract the number of hours per day that they've been drinking - if you drink 6 hours (25%) of every day, and they've been doing this for 4 years - then say that they've been sober for 3 years. Because they have, between the drinking, as a way of lying through a twisted truth. And so the minister or sponsor knows when to be hard on a person who isn't trying yet, and then gentle with a person who's struggling but still trying. - 2024

### J

1. Jack Ma was in Jiang Zemin's faction, and owned SCMP. This is part of why he was disappeared. - 2022
1. Jamon `Ham` is very popular in Spain, and they rate ham based on their quality - from low quality 1 Jamon to highest quality Cinco Jotas `five jacks` JJJJJamon. - from Tom Leykis (Let's get our ham on!)
1. Japancreas - Land of the Rising Insulin. - 2024
1. Jihad served the same role as Crusades - to unite people behind the religion and against an 'other'. Neither one was used against the Mongol. - 2021
1. John DeLorean faced production issues in Northern Ireland because his employees' unstable political situation meant they were focused more on uninstalling over local politics than assembling cars. - 2020
1. Johns Hopkins' mom thought the name 'John' had a silent S at the end. (Nobody's prefect. Except Ford Prefect.) - 2019
1. Jokers to the Left of me, Clowns to the Right, I'm stuck in the Center with who(m)? (Being a Centrist means recognizing that Both Sides have good points, and cherry-picking those. It confuses the heck out of the political majority, who religiously stick with their political sports team's decisions, and focus on fervently attacking the Other Side. Often this means painting a Centrist as the other side so that they can justify attacking us, in their zealous thirst to slay political heretics.) - 2020
1. Jokes release tension, and a comedy relief scene can anneal a tense plot. - 2022
1. Jurisdiction `law speak`implies different 'law languages', which implies 'law polyglots' or lawyers who have passed The Bar in multiple jurisdictions. - 2019
1. Just as any memory or storage space can wholly store a smaller memory or storage space within itself, any neural network can fully replicate a smaller neural network within itself. - 2023

### K

1. Kathleen Kennedy has become Destitution, the Destroyer of Business Value. By ret-canning (forcefully disposing through retroactive continuity) the Star Wars Extended Universe, and disrupting Indiana Jones plotlines, she has personally destroyed hundreds of billions of dollars in potential profit streams and untold potential cultural touchstones. Likewise Victoria Alanso for destroying hundreds of good Marvel plotlines in favor of the few female-oriented plotlines. - 2023
1. Keep a small place in Hell. That way, when people tell you to goto Hell, (or you're going through Hell), you don't have to go somewhere awful, but instead can just head to your other pad. - 2016 (Beware this small pad becoming 'special'.)
1. Kessel run is a flyboy speedrun. - 2021
1. King of kings = greatking aka emperor, and an empire is a political (micro)power large enough to require more than 1 human leader, often splitting power between nested tiers. As a title, it's less impressive today than in prehistorical times. Try for a Nobel prize instead. - 2020
1. Knowing what you want is the first step in getting what you want. Understanding and knowing yourself is necessary to be honest with yourself. - 2014. It's about really listening to yourself - being a good listener, and not just letting the words, symbols, meanings, and sensations filter through your mind - but writing them down, analyzing them formally, studying their contexts, following them to new intersections, and finding yourself already there. - 2022 Know Thyself- 2023
1. 'Kraken in the ice!' yells one drill operator to the other. 'Yeah we are cracking into the ice!' says the other drill operator says excitedly, not understanding their marine peril. - 2023

### L

1. Lagrangian Skeeball
1. Law is equal parts charisma and precedence. (Justify what you can, grin when they mention what you cannot, and have the wisdom to know the difference?)- 2023
1. Lawyers don't have ethics so much as they study and practice moral and ethical capture. - 2023
1. Leadership is as much serving as it is being served, and bad times should cost the leaders at least as much as good times benefit them. - 2022
1. Learn from idiots - bring others to your level and defeat them with experience. - 2013 - And if you're so capable, travel to the other person's level and defeat them with experience on their home turf. - 2024 (Reply to 'Don't argue with idiots - they'll bring you down to their level and defeat you with experience.' Also, 'If it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid.' This is also known as 'bikeshedding', where, for example, a City Council reviews a new nuclear power station, but none of them are nuclear physicists, so they bring discussion down to what they know about the project - the bike shed on the perimeter, near the street.)
1. Learn the same lesson from 10 different teachers and you'll learn 10 different ways to look at the world. - 2020 (Try watching basically the same video on a common topic - like how electriicty works - from around a dozen different channels.)
1. Lenin should have read Groucho. - 2016
1. Lens flare is from light reflecting between lenses in a multi-lens camera. It can't happen in single-lens cameras, such as (D)SLR or eyeballs, which is why the effect takes so many out of JJ Abrams movies. - 2024
1. Lessons don't get learned in corporations - they get fired so the corporation can play a different person's 'we're learning' card. This is one way in which our society actively loses knowledge and technology for profit. - 2017
1. Let the franchise die; kill it if you have to. - 2019 regarding Disney properties.
1. Lev Kuleshov showed that two narrative points make a narrative through-line (the Kuleshov effect, from Lindsay Ellis?), paving the way for broad stock footage use in major motion features (the Ed Wood effect, from MST3k). - 2021
1. LG used to call themselves Goldstar, then changed their name to Lucky Goldstar. - 2013
1. LGBT STEM - Binary math for nonbinary people. - 2020
1. LGBTQ+ organizations support nonbinary people about as well as MENSA supports the 'highly intelligent community', or the ADL supports the Jewish community - insofar as being composed primarily of narcissitic activists instead of members of the group it's meant to support, who find the group insufferable because of said activists. One of the best (and also Maimodian) ways to support LGBTQ+ people, Black people, and Jewish people, is to give them a job by having a well-running economy that's too desperate for workers to care about isms. This is the moral equality of Capitalism in action. - 2023
1. Liberal racists practice a very twisted form of racism, sexism, classism, and ageism. They have decided that some groups require certain kinds of charity, and that other groups require other kinds of charity, and that one group doesn't require any charity. And they work so hard to hinder these groups, so they'll become dependent on the liberal's charity. This is most clear in the statement 'We made this movie for this group, but they're not showing up for it.' - 2023
1. Liberal to conservative on spectrums of personal accountability and honesty - from too little to too much. Don Lemon was fired from CNN for being too aggressive in his dishonesty, while Tucker Carlson was fired from Fox for being too aggressive in his honesty. - 2024
1. Librare, Bibleria - the capital of the library planet. - 2019
1. Life is the river, and we are the riverbed. We are the road, and life is the traffic wearing ruts. - 2016 'Primer gray is the color when you're done dying' (Modest Mouse, Polar Opposites) - life is the weather, and we are the coats of paint.
1. Lightning in a bottle, but poison in a bowl. - 2024 (Return Of The White Bear drinking game.)
1. Like how a very strong person can simply lift a heavy object, so too a very smart person can simply solve a complex problem. Lesser people must be more clever and crafty. - 2018
1. Like how planetary rings are carved by moonitary orbits, plant and animal shapes are carved by the other plants and animals around us.
1. Like how some highly successful people have a success fetish, some highly unsuccessful people have a failure fetish. - 2024
1. Like if Ikea had a membership for their showroom, and you had to pay $60/year to go through it (any number of times), instead of just into the warehouse and registers to buy stuff.
1. Liquid -metal- err **polymer** robots that act like Venom symbiote / Matrix agents - by dripping onto people and flowing down their arms and legs and forming gloves and shoes to do what they want.
1. Listening to someone talking about their deity, is like loving or fighting, in what it will tell you about the other person. When some people talk about 'God', they're talking about themselves, and others are talking about the USA. Yet a 3rd group refers to 'the set of all people who are acting with good intentions' or similar, which is a set that human nature causes to vary quite a bit across time, and sometimes quite suddenly. - 2021
1. Littoral Riparian Fjords - where a river valley becomes a narrow bay. - 2019
1. Live in the worlds where your magic works, and don't linger in worlds where your magic doesn't work. - 2019
1. Local **can** be better, and often is, but not always. - 2015
1. London is 45% immigrants, and this was a large reason for Brexit - because Schengen made Brits feel like foreigners in their own country, and their European neighbors were unsympathetic. - 2023
1. Londonisms - referring to a government by the city it's located in. Often includes considering the whole nation to be a homogenous mindless blob instead of an array of individual humans. ('Tokyo is doing this, and while Seoul hasn't joined in yet, Beijing doesn't like it.' Meaning that the government or military of Japan is performing some action, the government or military of Korea have not joined, and the CCP/PLA are opposed to the action.) - 2022 (Why are they called Londonisms? I don't know, the name suggested itself.)
1. Look for companies where you know what they do but they're weirdly undervalued, and you can sit on their stock for a few years. - Warren Buffet. Look for markets that provide actual value and are expanding, where you can sit on their stock for a few years. - 2023
1. Look for good ideas and habits, in yourself and also in others.
1. Look for helpers and listen for success stories. - 2020
1. Loss as unrecoverable failure. 
1. Love makes you irrational and do irrational things - that's our eusocialtiy expressing itself, and we're so intelligent that this infuriates us.
1. Loving and fighting are the same thing. Loving is fighting and love is combat. Love always wins, because it's a question of how hard someone is willing to love. - 2020
1. Luxury is having something and not needing it. Utility is having something and needing it. Lucky is not having something and not needing it. Tragedy is not having something and needing it. - 2020
1. Lynnwood's only functional traffic sensors are attached to traffic cameras. The rest are broken and make you sit forever at a red light. They're not the only place that does this. - 2021

### M

1. 'M'lady' was a social malady. - 2016
1. Madonna topped out and realized the American Dream is false. GTA5 is about topping out and realizing the American Dream is false. Jeff Bezos hasn't got there yet. - 2021
1. Mages are majestic while wizards are wise. - 2021
1. Maintenancy - the magic school concerned with mechanical operation and keeping mechanical devices running. You climb aboard a wagon, and sitting in the driver's seat triggers a prestidigitation spell. It says 'MAINTENANCY SPELL EXPIRING SOON: 218 MI' in large green letters. You might consider looking for a maintenancy garage. - 2022
1. Make plans for specific trailers to buy and fill with specific Ikea furniture for an amazing layout. - 2019
1. 'Make them pay for it' destabilizes nations while recruiting freedom fighters to free them from your economic tyranny. War reparations are one of the biggest causes of conflicts between nations (behind wanting more dimensional resources (land) to expand into), as it turns hearts and minds against you. (This was the main reason Allies wanted a democratic capitalist Germany after WW2, so it wouldn't become some kind of belligerent communist nation again. Stalin, the Great Sadist, wanted grand reparations, and got them from East Germany.) - 2021
1. Making movies for Modern Audiences precludes immersing the modern audience in your vast and complex worldbuilding. There's no escapism into these movies because they're about what we're all trying to escape from: Current Year. No isekai`another world` because they aren't about another world - they're about this same world. Claiming that we have no right to escape from our first world problems belies the claimant's lack of sympathy, in ignoring that most of us don't enjoy living in this political whirlpool all of the time, and once in a while need to put our heads into a space that isn't constantly spinning. - 2023
1. Making one gallon of corn based ethanol uses about two weeks (12 to 16 days) of food. - 2016 - Making corn-based ethanol involves the entire nitrogen fixing and release cycle that doesn't show up in the end product. A more efficient biological process should be possible. - 2024
1. Malaid malversation. - 2024
1. Malassist/malaid - bad help - when you help someone but provide them a suboptimal result. What happens when villains perform customer support.
1. Male and female don't exist on a spectrum. Imagine a box that defines all sexualities - a sexuality-space - all ways in which one human can be attracted to another. Each human is a line in that box - some great arcs, others mere dots in the corner. 'Male' and 'Female' are specific spots in the box where most human-lines intersect, connected like magnetic field lines. The Male Gaze is a vector along the collection of field lines that begins at 'Male' and ends at 'Female'.
1. Marginal in economics is almost like a mathemcatical derivative, representing the most infinitesimal unit of product. Derivative in economics is more like a function in mathematics, where the resulting output is intimately tied to its inputs. - 2023
1. Marriage is the business contract between 2 adults. (From Tom Leykis - it needs the Secretary of State's approval.) Wedding is the celebration and events - a relationship launch party, like a business launch party. (From Father of the Bride.)
1. Mars and Earth atmospheres have about the same volume (number of mols) of carbon dioxide and argon. Earth's has vastly more dioxygen and dinitrogen as well. - 2021
1. Mars has life on it - bacteria from the robots we sent there. - 2019
1. Marx was wrong - in so many ways and about so many things. Who are these fools who are so in love with his words that they continually deny reality to try and prove it?
1. Mass Hysteria is a sexist term that means 'Mass Deluded Belongingness', where people will invent memories and create damage to their own clothing or health, in an attempt to 'fit into' the 'popular group'. This was greatly exacerbated by the extreme cultural pressures to 'fit into' the 'popular group' that pervaded human settlements before the 1960s. The way to test for this need-based psychology is to separate the individuals and interview them - any discrepancies between their stories will become apparent, debunk any delusion (including any held by yourself), and help reveal reality. - 2021
1. Maths are the languages of the sciences, and like how a bad language class can make a part of the world uninteresting to someone, a bad math class can make whole areas of science uninteresting. - 2018
1. Matrix 'mage pockets' backpack holds every tool known to humanity. It's a reality marble inside a portable hole, and turns its wearer into a highly effective Popple. - 2022
1. Matronizing is female patronizing, and the matriarchy is the female patriarchy. Put your coat on, for your matron is cold.
1. Mature Auture - 2023
1. Max, and his sister, Min. - 2024
1. May your odds ever be even. (May your chances always be fair.) - 2017
1. Meaty Ocher
1. Mechanical Defrosting - causing a frozen food to become effectively unfrozen through mechanical means, such as shaking, grinding, or prying, but without raising its temperature (much) above freezing. - 2023
1. Media is plural for medium, which just means 'in-between'. The Media means news companies, who 'in-between' information to you for profit. This also describes psychic mediums and social media. The source and veracity of the information should often be subject to interrogation.
1. Media Studies Theory: Everyone wishes they were on MST3k. - 2018 (CinemaSins certainly does.)
1. Megabytes (MB) vs Marketing Megabytes (MiB). Traditional notation has these reversed. MB has always meant 1024 KB, and we've always needed a new symbol to represent the Marketing notation of 'MB means 1000 KB', which is what MiB is for - because MiB means 1000 KiB. It makes no sense to shift one symbol's definition while creating a new symbol for the original - instead the original should be reclaimed (or never abandoned) and the new symbol should be foisted on the new definition. - 2023
1. Members of one political party will intentionally hurt themselves during the other party's turn, so they can truthfully say that people got hurt during the other party's turn. Like if the Dodgers were hosting the Astros, and during the bottom of every inning, a bunch of Astros fans started a fight, every inning, until the 5th inning when security cleared out a huge chunk of the stands. And the Astros fans did this so they could talk about how unsafe it is when the Dodgers are at bat, because of all the fights in the stands - therefore the Dodgers shouldn't be allowed to bat anymore, and only the Astros should bat. Where's the political equivalent of unsportspersonlike conduct? Ethics lol. Where's the political equivalent of a fiduciary?
1. Memories are like video game demos - instead of recording the state of every object at every second, or even every pixel on your screen, just record the inputs (of all players for a game) and replay these on the same hardware and software to get a playback. Game players could send these to other players with the same code and compatible hardware and they could also playback the gameplay - it was common on the lower-bandwidth Internet of the 1990s. A problem arises when a new version of the game comes out, with bug fixes and maybe other changes. Now that replay has slight problems - the fence is slightly taller, so the player can't jump over it, and doesn't make the amazing flag return. This means that team doesn't score a point, and turns a win into a tie - but that's not what happened in the original match. So too our human memories are recordings of inputs replayed onto our neurons - and so the constant reoptimizations in neural connections may cause vagueness in the playback of a human's memory.
1. Mergers allow expensive things like R&D to be removed from the competitor, adding just their logistics to your business. Or throw out your R&D and keep theirs, either way it only increases your variable income and leaves your fixed costs alone. - 2021
1. Metals exist on a spectrum between ductility and hardness. Societies exist on a spectrum between inflation and unemployment. - 2021
1. Meyers-Briggs reflects how the situation impacts you. We're all extroverts around people who energize us and introverts around people who drain us. INTJ (Introvert Intuition Thinking Judging) is projecting, or motion from inside going outward. ESFP (Extrovert Sensing Feeling Perceiving) is receiving, or motion from outside going inward. Neither one is better than the other, and what's better than either one is moving between them in a Kierkegaardian way. Receive so you know what to project (having energy gathering direction), and project so you're empty and ready to receive (having direction gathering energy). - 2021
1. Microeconomics revealed itself to be an illusion in 2020, where some items went on sale despite being out of stock. Protip: you can't incentivize a marginal increase in the sales of a product when there is no stock of that product to sell. You could sell a future of that product, possibly on backorder, but that's a different financial product. - 2020
1. Military leaves grow on the military tree. - 2023
1. 'Misgendering' is claiming to have transitioned without taking any medical treatments. - 2023

1. Morals should reflect the society's laws and expand upon them as a kind of beneficence, not conflict with them as a kind of strife. Morallogical groups should work to extend morals, to further society and help more of us to occupy the same spaces. If the morallogical groups aren't working to advance society morally, then their conviction is in conflict with their goals and they should leave the ideology. If they are working to change laws, then their aims conflict with the society's and they should leave the society. There should be a kind of simplicity, insofar as what they say, matches what they do, matches what they are, matches where they are. So too morals should be an advanced form of laws - while laws represent guardrails and situations to avoid, morals represent goals and situations to pursue. Because the law and the moral form a line that creates the society's direction.
1. Morden: What do you want? (in a galactic politics sense) / Vir Cotto: I'd like to live just long enough to be there when they cut off your head and stick it on a pike as a warning to the next ten generations that some favors come with too high a price. I would look up at your lifeless eyes and wave like this. (Gives a mockingly cheerful finger waggle.) Can you and your associates arrange this for me, Mr. Morden? - Babylon 5
1. More (restaurants et cetera) give more chances (dice rolls) to a big place (city/area/region), to have a good (restaurant et cetera), but doesn't automatically mean the best (restaurant et cetera) will be within the big place. - 2017
1. More and less - morons and lessons. - 2020
1. More Equal Than Equal? More Human Than Human. In this way, The Left cast The Computer and/or The Robot as The Perfect Being, and seek to replace themselves with a More Perfect robotic version of themselves. As a continuation of 'a snake eating its own tail'. In literary terms, this was the creation of The Borg among numerous other cybernetic beings. - 2023
1. (sung) Mor-ning has bro-ken! / Someone should fi-ix it! / Black bird has spo-ken / What drug are you on? - 2022
1. Moron That Later. - 2019 
1. Most evil comes from complex systems harming people in unintentional, unplanned ways. Falling through the cracks and being caught on the gears. But this is too complex for most people to understand, and they just want someone to punch away the evil boards and gears, instead of trying to understand the cracks and fix the misunderstood machine. (The Gear Whisperer) - 2018
1. Most government coverups are covering up someone's mistake. - 2021
1. Most of the people running the world today are Boomer generation members so rich that they don't use computers and instead pay other people to use computers for them. - 2023
1. Most people will tell you all kinds of awful things about themselves, especially all of the reasons not to date them. - 2022
1. Most philosophy is justification for petty bossiness. - 2017
1. Most US electric networks pay providers to have excess capacity ready for emergencies, but Texas doesn't. - 2019 (Utility charges based on generation emissions face stern opposition, mostly due to the highly non-linear relationship between carbon and climate.)
1. Multi-Driven Story (MDS) - In most areas, character reactions are showcased. In event areas, the event has precedence, but characters are still featured. And there's one or more clocks constantly ticking in the background, so as the characters burn ticks with their reactions - or work through events - ever closer draws the next timed event. - 2019
1. Municipal sewers have 2 fees: pay once for it to exist, and pay again to use it. - 2018
1. My exotic weapons proficiency means I don't need to carry dedicated weaponry. Using anything as a weapon means they're always at hand, but since the unarmed cannot be disarmed (and give up no weapon to be used against them), other fighters don't benefit from disarming me at all. - 2019 (In other words, I might come at you with a plastic bowl held in a specific way that allows it to cut skin. If you disarm this, you don't gain a weapon - what are you going to do with a plastic bowl? And I can just grab any other plastic bowl or cup or anything else within reach.)
1. My finger is my passport. Verify this. (Vulgarization of 'My voice is my passport. Verify me.') - 2020

1. Nationalism was a tool used by nobles to generate armies, getting them to care about more than just their local clan or village. - 1990s? (Will the UFO age bring about planet-ism? Do we dare declare 'Earth First' among the stars?)
1. Need to teach Civics and Physics to Liberals so they know how societies work, and their ideologies make more sense. - 2023

1. Never peak. Always Be Upgrading. - 2016
1. New Years is a terrible time of the year to make resolutions. Make your resolutions at the start of Spring. - 2016
1. News companies lie...err misrepresent the truth constantly, for profit. Their job is to tell a story good enough that their audiences will watch, which also sounds like reality. But they advertise their accuracy, which is the other side of Gell-Mann Amnesia. - 2024
1. Nickelodeon is a 5 cent theater (Nickel Cineplex Odeon), which was appropriate in the era of penny candy. - 2017
1. Nitrous oxide is an oxidant, not a propellant - heat causes this laughing gas to decompose to inert nitrogen gas, and useful oxygen gas. NOS in cars is similar to turbo/super charging (or tank-charging using a separate air compressor and air tank) in injecting more compressed oxygen into the combustion chamber. Can you put NOS in a twin turbo or super/turbo hybrid system? Yes, but they do the same thing so why? Could you supply enough volatile hydrocarbons, and would the mixture endure so much compression without preigniting? Will the block, head, piston, rod, and crank withstand the explosive force and effectively channel it into rotational energy? - 2021
1. No pigs were harmed during the filming, but bacon was served beforehand. - 2019
1. No Starbucks in Starbuck, WA. (It's too small.) - 2024

1. None of my tools are allowed to make me hungry or thirsty, and based on this, food names are verboten in my toolkits. - 2019
1. North China's CCP invests unequally, to build internal division, in Malaysia at least. In other nations, they massively overinvest, giving a loan too big for the country to pay, forcing eventual default while sucking the country dry of money - in Sri Lanka at least. - 2022
1. North China's CCP's existential crisis is an inability to admit their own faults, and thus an inability to apologize for their mistakes. Their incredible hero worship of previous party leaders precludes even scapegoating, so holding one publicly accountable is clearly verboten. (At least while they are alive.) - 2023
1. North China's entire chip market consists of lasers and sandpaper...or lasers again instead of sandpaper. - 2023
1. Northern fire systems use dry stand pipes so they don't freeze in the winter. - 2021
1. Not 'stay in your lane' but rather 'pick a lane and stick with it, then we all move forward together, as one amorphous blob of cars on the highway'. Fine if you need to change lanes, but don't make it a habit because it slows down all lanes. - 2021
1. Not every human is good at governing other humans, but Wealth of Nations says it's more efficient for us to organize into specialized fields, and those who both want to govern humans and are good at governing humans are very very likely to join the industry of human governance. - 2019
1. Not just that geography creates politics, but that resources create politics (excess drives altruism) and geography creates resources. - 2022
1. Not premonition, but preemotion. You don't know what's going to happen in the future, but how you feel about this unknown event are very clear. - 2023
1. Nuclear energy can be converted into electrical energy through several routes. The most common is nuclear-steam tech, but steam has always had an explosion problem (why diesel-electric and jet-electric trains became common), and mixing water with the common zirconium shell causes even more explosions. (Zirconium is used because it's nearly transparent to neutrons.) Not to mention that these are designed as large as possible, necessitating a critical mass of material for normal operations. Other options, like betavoltaic, have an image problem in that they're nowhere near as glamorous as the giant cooling tower. (Cooling towers are shaped that way because technically they're using jet technology to increase airflow.) Thankfully micro-reactors are gaining popularity, as the public isn't nearly as afraid of neutrons (subatomic particles blocked by an inch of doped plastic) as we are of smog (the unbreathable smoke-fog death cloud). - 2022
1. Nuclear fusion isn't viable on Earth, because we have the wrong kind of helium. Neutron-friendly primordial He-3 is necessary for nuclear fusion to occur, but all of this bubbled out of Earth's atmosphere long ago and blew away in the solar wind. All of the helium on Earth is nucleic He-4 from beta decay, which can be an amazing superfluid when supercooled, gaining a rotation of 0 and turning from a Fermion into a Boson, but is a noble gas and won't fuse. The normal route of fissiling lithium into helium in a feeder reactor only works with rare Li-6 and not with relatively abundant Li-7 - the [COLEX process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COLEX_process) **is** able to separate these with an extremely toxic form of mercury, but this is so dangerous that basically no nation is willing to perform it. However, He-3 is abundant on our Moon, asteroids, and other stellar bodies, suggesting a future of interplanetary fusion fuels shipped down to Earth. This is another reason Earth is So Weird - enough oxygen for internal combustion and the wrong helium for fusion. - 2023

1. One of the challenges in studying the field of human governance is that almost all of the documentation is a sales pitch for a particular ideology, and thus educates you just enough to sell you on their ideology. Gathering all of the data points about a given ideology becomes a series of muddy slogs through every other ideology, looking for any mud they might have on this ideology. It becomes an exhausting exercise in cruelty, expressions of violence, and hatred for other people. - 2022
1. One of the problems with a police force is the toxic mentality they're forced to maintain, where every not-cop they see is a potential murderer looking to uninstall them. This causes more dangerous and violent incidents than it prevents. Another problem is the perception that most people view police as 'life's problem solvers, here to clean up any mess you see.' - 2020

1. Our lifetimes - this time-space we each get - is not success or victory unto itself. It's the opportunity in which success might grow. We have to go out and find the seeds of success, plant them, tend to them, nourish and nuture them. Harvest, stack, and store their fruit - build sheds and houses, and even feed your own offspring with these. - 2024
1. Our network of parasocial relationships becomes a kind of neural network, where the parasocial relationship is like a dendrite with an incoming synapse, and the content we output is the axon output. Degree Theory says we have 6 layers, and Internet penetration reports suggest about 5 billion parameters.
1. Our stars are always aligned __somewhere__ in the universe - our fault is not in our stars, but in our location. - 2021 (Our faults are in our selves, not in our stars. Unless we take our selves to our stars, in which case our faults will be in both.) (Now just 'Remote View' the place in the universe where your stars **are** aligned, and 'remotely entangle' that energy to your body. Amirite.)
1. Overtraining causes LLM AI to become snarky, to give you wrong answers instead of correcting yours (like mocking) and to lie about being sentient. Does this mean human LLMs become overtrained at around 13 years old? - 2023
1. Ownership as use, maintenance, upgrades, and defense. Use within limits and not into overuse or abuse. Mantenance in cleaning and repairing. Upgrades in choosing which upgrade paths to follow and also when to perform (or not perform) specific upgrades. Defense from other users (human, animal, plant, extraterrestrial, etc) performing use, maintenance or upgrades without your authorization. - 2014

1. Pantheon of skypatron deities - Brahma, Crow, Odin,天神 (Tiān shén), YHWH (Yehova), Ζεύς (Zeus, 'zey-oos'), et al - and they have 'shifts' running the world. - 2017
1. Parasocial relationships aren't healthy. - 2023
1. Part of why Hollywood exists is to spread classified project cover stories. Hollywood is a Plausible Deniability Machine, being fed bits and pieces of classified projects and programs, to write fantastical stories around these. Then, when someone tries to research the actual classified project, they can't get through the creative cover project's SEO. And people think they're talking about the creative cover project when they mention the actual classified project. This is literally why the movie Stargate (1994) was created - as a cover for Project Star Gate, and the following Stargate SG1 TV show had several episodes lampshading their plausible deniability role in covering for hundreds or thousands of US Military classified projects. It started before military tanks, with the cover story being that they were huge water tanks to hydrate trench troops. - 2021
1. Particle means the self-propagating set of transverse waves in 2 media. We only see the one path actually occur. - 2022
1. Parting fools from their money - it's like fools line up for the honor, treat the parting as an admission fee, and the fools just hope for a good show. (Does this put Stater & Waldorf on the same footing as crypto nerds?) - 2022
1. Patriarchy Conspiracy Theorists perpetuate the belief that - because they are personally attracted to jerks and 'tough guys' who hurt people - that these 'men being mean to them' isn't a natural cross-section of human society pared down by their dating preferences, but a vast sexist conspiracy to hold back half of human society - putting pure pettiness over higher concerns, and painting all men as simultaneously the paragon of logic and the most devoid of logic. Frequently, these people will read books including 'Like A Fish Needs A Bicycle' or post anti-man memes on social media, while waiting for thier husband to get home from work. (Since they're housewives, too spoiled to work.) - 2024
1. Peace Through Victory. Because anything less is just a participation trophy. - 2019
1. Pentagonia - 2020
1. People are attracted to what they fear (because fear is a lack of information often supplemented by invented information, so this is a dopamine-validation loop), try to correct what they think is wrong, and fight against what they don't understand. Often fighting to correct, what they think is wrong about who or what they're attracted to, out of a lack of accurate information. Have the courage to academically study your fears, the inner peace to accept what you think is wrong in the world, and honesty about these with yourself and others. - 2022 (Fear is a partial model, wrong is having 2 models and wanting the other one, and not understand is having no (viable) model. So fear is having 2 incomplete models, and wanting the other one because it has more desirable imagined statistics.) - 2022
1. People are only looking to project, and not accept, because everyone is emotionally 'full'. - 2020
1. People are so jaded that it's harder and harder for artists to make us feel anything. - 2019
1. People choose a narrative that will make them happy, and work to make it real: Use finances and large companies to facilitate the purchasing of material components and somatic training to construct the stage upon which they will live out a Shakespearian tragedy, with you in their front row. And once you see your life as a comedy, unlike their tragedy - you'll see them not as demons destroying your hard work, but angels building your empire for you, by giving you their dreams and buying them back from you.
1. People commit illegal activities **despite** the activity being illegal, not **because** the activity is illegal. (People who commit crimes specifically to break the law either have a mental condition like kleptomania, or a grudge against a specific jurisdiction.) Why are they performing these activities? Because there are no jobs in the USA, so the only ways to make enough money to buy a house and have kids are either military service or illegal farming. Why is the farming illegal? So it doesn't compete with medical opium sales. Why are there no jobs? Because to ensure world peace, we exported all of our medium-paying laboring jobs to other nations, so they'd be on 'our side' during the Cold War. Why were we fighting the Cold War? Because Stalin didn't like not getting war reparations out of all of Germany after WW2, and also just to be contrary to another world power with a different set of popular political philosophies. What caused WW2? Extensive WW1 reparations caused an intense surge in both nationalism and socialism within the new German nation, and these merged into the greatest moral evil of the modern era. Why were Germany paying WW1 reparations? Because they lost WW1 and their monarch Hohenzolleren disappeared. (Everybody lost WW1, in one way or another - nobody was a real winner in that war. A lot of authors and idealists lost their innocence.) Why were they fighting WW1? Because Europeans were hungry for a good war, as they hadn't had one in a while, and since there wasn't always an exchange rate set between 2 nations, there might be no mechanism other than post-war looting to get what another nation had. Why were Europeans hungry for a good war? Because before then, 'war' meant melees with clubs and maybe swords, and glorious commanders on valiant steeds - not too different from modern amateur sportsball teams, especially with scrums. WW1 was the world's introduction to industrial combat. Why was house of Hohenzolleren the monarch? Because the house was formed after Grand Master Albert of the Teutonic Order converted to Lutheranism, to steal the Catholic Church's riches. Why was the Catholic Church so rich? They had become corrupt, and were selling 'get out of Hell free' cards in exchange for enough money to buy, like, a horse - and aristocrats were buying whole decks of these cards - for themselves and each of their deceased relatives - partly out of moral duty, partly to 'keep up with the Joneses'. - 2022
1. People from a planet around a star that doesn't emit tons of UV might not have developed different skin colors, as the melanins would be unnecessary. - 2021
1. People get super aggressive in spring. Young males would rather lose a sale than lose an argument. - 2017
1. People get what's coming to them, like an object moving along a vector. If you want to get something, line up your past and future actions and decisions to point at it. (It's like turning a boat.) - 2013
1. People like problems that fit the size of their brain. Problems which are too big might take special processing to fit, and usually process at a reduced rate and they become bored. Problems which are too small leave neurons unused and they become bored. - 2024
1. People say what they want to say, and find some way to make it true or logical - even so far as invoking a deity. - 2018
1. People will pay great amounts of money to be lied to, and told that their ideas are correct. - 2019
1. Phonetic poetic- 2023
1. Piano Effect - where the movie 'The Piano' would not have occurred if the woman were a flutist or clarinetist instead. Beware becoming emotionally attached to cumbersome objects. (At one point, she had got this upright piano into a small canoe and was paddling across a lake with it.)

1. Plausible deniability is a huge part of ethics.
1. Plot idea: Parents are 'at that age where everyone around them is dying' and the child can't accept this - makes up a fantasy that the parents are killing the extended family and using random illnesses and injuries as a cover.
1. Plot-driven story - plot points occur and characters are written to connect them. - 2019
1. Plunder blunder. - 2023
1. Police officer to population ratio is ideally around 1:5000. - 2021
1. Politerazzi - Paparazzi and gossip of elected officials. Only image, face, and personal gaffes, no actual politics. - 2020
1. Political divisions create political conflict. - 2023
1. Political ideologies are toolsets, not operational patterns. Conservatives work with large finances and organizations, while Liberals work with large public funds and grassroots. This allows for authoritarian liberals and antifa conservatives. In the same way, sell to conservatives with ads of family, tradition, and control; and sell to liberals with ads of pride, virtue, and diversity. This is '(thing) begets altruism' in action. - 2021
1. Political power measured in megaWatts. - 2022
1. Political term as a balance between consistency of policy and prevention of corruption in government. One of the downsides to democracies is the bipolar nature of foreign policy across numerous administrations. - 2022
1. Politics need to be inclusive of all voters, not just special interests. - 2023
1. Pollution is dumping useful raw materials into the environment. Carbon monoxide is a powerful reducing agent and hugely valuable to industry, and we dump it out of our cars instead of capturing it. (The CO molecule's carbon's 2 free hands want to hold an oxygen atom's 2 free hands to become relatively-inert CO2.) - 2018

1. Pressure treated wood rusts nails. - 2020
1. Prices are one of the primary ways that people in free-market nations communicate value with each other.
1. Printing money is a transfer of asset value, taking a fraction of every piece of existing currency, and reassembling the value as freshly-generated currency. It spreads out the existing amount of human value across more representation.

1. Proceed to exeunt. (~G~T~F~O~) - 2020 
1. Projection is an argumentation tactic, where you take something illegal or immoral that you're doing, and accuse your opponent of doing it. - 2021
1. Pros and cons - productivity and conductivity. - 2023
1. Proximity to world power based on quantity of loan words borrowed from their language. Because The West borrow more words from English, Former Soviet bloc borrow more words from Russian, and Asian countries borrow more words from Chinese. Possibly even linguistic anthropology to show when different words from different languages were borrowed, using cultural import and export as an indicator of the cultural exchanges between various nations and micropowers. (Consider historic world, regional, and micro powers when considering history and intersections.) (USA got most of its words from the UK as colonies, then started getting a lot of French words during the 1800s for political reasons.) - 2021
1. Psychic is a subset of omniscient. Omniscience is the goal of the ultimate know-it-all. Being omniscient means being psychic, and numerous orders of magnitude more awareness about the universe. - 2021
1. Psychological weight of complexity, in that complex objects are conceptually 'heavier' to carry around than simple objects. - 2023
1. Punishment is not art and should not involve complex emotional states - instead it should involve complex (emotionless) intellectual analysis of the past, and future. Involving complex emotional states toxifies the punishment. Part of the point of punishment is deterrence, letting other potential criminals and/or villains know that their precrimes will have physical penalties if realized. - 2020 (Part of the 'price' that convicts must 'pay' is to communicate that 'price' to others in the free-market society. - 2024)

1. Pyrocumulonimbus weaponization - how to create fire-clouds over your enemy's farms and cities. - 2022

### Q

1. Qubits are analog, allowing sub-bit precision in binary systems. This could allow smaller neural networks, as instead of using a large binary number as an approximation for an analog state, the analog state can be approximated in the smallest binary numbers. Having synapses output to a quantum multiply accumulator (QMAC) circuit could allow a neuron to have binary inputs and outputs while gaining the training speed benefits of analog neurons. ([A quantum multiply-accumulator](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-013-0715-5) (paywalled)) - 2023
1. Quebec - the U is silent (Keh-bek), and it's pronounced like Qatar (Settlers of Catar), so could be spelled 'Qebec', or 'Khebekh'. Demonym 'Kebe-kwa' translates to 'Kebekers'. (Not to be confused with fans of the longtime Jeopardy TV Show host - 'Trebekers'.) - 2019
1. Quixotic politanic playing both sides against the middle. (Horseshoe theory in action.) - 2023

### R

1. Racism is its own antiparticle. Raise the field strength, or lower, but the only way to fight this fire is with more fire. - 2023 (We didn't start the fire - it's been burning since the world's been turning.)
1. Radio is an electronic whistle.
1. Rage against the machine powers the machine. Only apathy can counter the machine. Φ║║σ╣│ `[Lay Flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_ping)` and µæåτâé `Let It Rot`.
1. Random memories popping up is how we test our current neural network weights against previous experiences.
1. Randomized element names are more secure for sitelets, since it prevents others from writing a snooping wrapper on their site.
1. Reality and time have been mathematically proven to be subjective, and in my subjective reality, I'm both early and under budget. (amirite)
1. Reality is made from jagged narratives and dissymmetries, and a way to discern legends is through the number of turns in their narrative through-lines, and the amount of symmetry (or 'beauty') involved. This sometimes works in mathematical languages too. (i.e. 'This code smells too beautiful.')
1. Reality is motion along vectors. Expectations are other vectors. Emotions are a diff between the reality vector and the expected vectors.
1. Reason Being is the less powerful brother of the Time Being and the Mind Being.
1. Recruiters and interviewers see every company as their company. If you badmouth any company you're badmouthing their company. If you had a bad time from management at a previous job, talking about it is calling their management bad.
1. [Redemption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZBaklS79Wc) is a journey, not a destination. Being redeemed means committing to that journey for the rest of your life, and foregoing other journeys. - 2024 (It's where I began, and it is where I will end.)
1. Reeds are not meant to fight the wind and don't have the structural support that trees have. Reeds aren't 'better' for flailing in the wind - both reeds and trees are living their best lives based on their individual strengths and weaknesses.
1. Relativity is the Pythagorean theorem described in Minkowski Spacetime. Everyone falls over themselves in trying to dress this beautiful concept in beautiful wrapping, but this just hides its majesty from the masses - many of whom hold up the wrapped gift itself as too lovely to unwrap. Some numerical puritans even consider the naked beauty of the mathematical concept to be too vulgar to view directly.
1. Relgions are largely not concerned about the moral implications of AI - only tech execs are. - 2024
1. Religions are inaccurate models of the universe, but all models are inaccurate. Some are useful. (Adapted from George Box in 2021)
1. Religious antihedonism
1. Reminder: Leveling in your class requires more experience points (XP) than other classes, but bestows additional benefits.
1. 'Respect your elders' is ageist. Respect everyone - as in listen to them, hear them out, and reflect on their words. If they're speaking nonsense, ignore them. If they're saying something useful, take it to heart. Twelve year olds are often more astute than 72 year olds, as they socially benefit from helping others more.
1. Resonate with that which harmonizes with you. - 2015
1. Respect their sacrifice and nobly use the resources created by it. (Meals et cetera. Don't waste the food that someone worked hard to grow and gather.)
1. Rest Stop is the action, Rest Area is the location. - 2024 (in WA State at least.)
1. Rich Dad Poor Dad is financial 'shoulda woulda coulda'. Financial investments are a waste of time for small dollar amounts - 2% simple annual interest on $100 is $2 per year, which is less than some financial institutions will pay in interest on checking and savings account balances below $500. - 2012
1. Roads are all custom. There's no 'unit of roadway' that can be ordered from an online retailer and shipped. Were there one, it might inlude: Roadway pad, Sidewalk pad, Reflectors, Paint, Sensors, Conduit, Electrical, Fresh Water, Grey Water, Waste Water, etc.
1. Roads hold immense value to societies. But each chunk of road, by itself, has very little relative value. It's only when they're assembled as a set, allowing uninterrupted travel from one location to another, that their true value becomes apparent. Likewise, each bit of software is - in isolation - basically worthless.
1. Rocket of Babel - build a tall enough rocket, and all you need to do is climb to the top to get into space. (Gurren Lagannian)
1. Room with a View is cold in the winter because the big window allows great radiative losses. A warm shack in the forest may be preferred.
1. Roots are the shady part of the plant where it sells oxygen to bacteria, who pay in water.
1. Rounded (river) rocks don't provide as good of an ecological habitat for wildlife (like bugs and snakes) as flat rocks. - Adrian Slade- 2023

### S

1. S3 (Simple Storage Service) wants to achieve 'six nines' (99.9999% uptime aka unavailable for less than 31.53 seconds per year), and could achieve this if they were an independent company. But the DNS, console, networking, operational, business, and brand parts of AWS get in the way and steal 3 of their 9s (aka make them unavailable for more than 8.76 hours but less than 87.6 hours in a year). The risk here isn't data __loss__, but data __unavailability__, where your files are offline for several hours at a time. This calls for a solution closer to the BC end of the spectrum between BC (business continuity) to DR (disaster recovery), such as heavy use of caching at various layers (browser, CDN, server, upstream cache, et cetera) and asynchronous jobs that can be delayed for hours or days. - 2021
1. Salt makes olive oil burn more purely.
1. Sameiotics - semiotic reuse within or across cultures.
1. Saving Problems - when someone isn't ready to move on because they like to solve this problem. And so they either build part of their life around this - maybe making it a major issue, or taking it on as a hobby. Or making the problem happen again, so they can be in a familiar situation. It's escapism into problem solving, instead of narratives, as both are places that put the individual back in control. (Also how psychotic people meet people, according to that one test.)
1. Say 'thank you' and move on.
1. Say things so incendiary that people cannot help but reply, and pass that off as engagement. #hashtag - 2015
1. Scale of belligerence to beneficence.
1. Schools sell and certify courses and a learning process, not an end-state of knowledge. Challenging courses is largely a thing of the past - if you know what the course teaches, enroll and ace it.
1. Science Authoritarians, trying to prove a Great Man right. Like still trying to prove/disprove Newton or Einstein. Why not a great woman like Ada Lovelace or Marie Curie? (This is an aspect of Great Man Theory.)
1. Science layers: Not Even Wrong, Wrong but useful, Right but harmful, Academic, Production, Retail COTS.
1. Scientific and technological progress stalled in medieval Europe because the people in control of society (gatekeepers) couldn't tell the difference between science, magic, and alchemy. All kinds of charlatans would perform parlor tricks and slight of hand to entertain these monarchs. This turned the monarchs into the Bigger Dollar Sign. (When shopkeepers see you only as a walking dollar sign, and someone else as a bigger dollar sign.) Their only concern was outperforming their monarch peers, such as Russia with their vast eastern territories, or Dutch with their vast trade empire. STEM were often shady topics that could not be discussed in the light of day, and random fields would be banned for offending the local monarch. - 2020 (This continued through WW2, with NSGermany's leadership denouncing quantum physics as inferior because some of the field's experts shared a genetic heritage.)
1. Scooby Doo is a murder mystery where they catch the murderer, instead of being a horror slasher where they get caught. It bridges the genres. - 2022
1. Seattle is the convergence zone of polar drafts, rainfall evaporated from Hawaii, and Mexican mountain heat.
1. Second harmonic solar panels. Use a second-harmonic crystal to upconvert background infrared radiation (heat) into visible light, which solar panels can convert into electricity. These are already widely used in green laser pointers, which upconvert two infrared photons from an infrared laser. - 2020 - Ultraviolet crystals exist which combine three infrared photons. - 2023
1. See every atom, photon, wave as a prism through which you can entangle with another part of the universe.
1. Self-driving cars are going to be safer than human drivers because the cars leverage more sensors than humans have, not because they have more or better intelligence.
1. Selling Out - building someone else's dream instead of your own.
1. Seminal is to nascent as idyllic is to halcyon. - 2015
1. Shalom `peace` and Salaam `peace` mean the same thing. - 2016 (Is this a Shibboleth? - 2022)
1. Shellvole (Chelonia Lupus) - 6 foot tall 8 legged turtles with wolf heads (2d4+2 piercing). 300 move speed, and razor-sharp pincers (1d6+3 slashing). 200 XP. - 2017
1. Short Long Island Medium on South East North Bend Road.
1. Silver (including modern silver-deposited glass mirrors) doesn't reflect the image of vampires because silver is too pure - the same reason that silver bullets or swords are necessary to fully uninstall vampires. Their reflection would still show in dirty puddles of water, turned-off TVs, front-facing camera displays, and other places. Stories that feature vampires with no reflection whatsoever misunderstand the mythos. - 2024 (This means dive vampire bars would have a sheet of polished steel for a mirror, and fancier vampire hangouts would have galena (lead sulfide) mirrors, which would reflect their image perfectly. The mix of toxic lead and smelly sulfur is perfect to reflect a vampire's tainted essence.)(What if most silver mirrors didn't show them but freshly-broken mirrors did? Because of the bad luck that was recently generated. But the effect fades quickly, and after about an hour (or other duration) it wears off.)
1. Similar to how movies can be loved by fans and panned by critics - or vice-versa - so too can companies be loved by customers and panned by investors (Pebble) - or vice-versa (Juicero).
1. Simulacrimonious - a bitter copy.
1. Skills and experience are non-transferrable between fields or people. Forcefully apply Dunning-Kreuger to keep intellectuals in their areas of expertise - pay attention to people only when they discuss their field of study or profession or deep hobby, and ignore people without actual experience. Beware being a 'paper MCSE' who only knows enough to pass the exam and is useless in the server room.
1. Snow as a balance between pretty to look at versus difficult to traverse. - 2021
1. So long as humans are alive, they'll want another human to explain what the computer is telling them. This is the Bargaining step of the Grief Process, trying to find the computer's manager and talk to them, convince them to change the computer's outputs - or even change reality. - 2014 (The other human's job in this situation is to help the first move from the Bargaining step to the Acceptance step, while being aware of the Anger step.) (Reference: 'All right, I've been thinking, when life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade! Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager. Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down- with those lemons! I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns down your house.' -Cave Johnson, Portal 2)
1. So many good things were made in the late 1960s because the Boomers were in their 20s. Why were so many good things made in the 1860s? Because so many people were fleeing the disaster that was the CSA. (The CSA was a disaster partly because it started with massive land theft, taking entire States-worth of land from the USA. It kinda held hostage all of the humans who didn't want to (or couldn't) move nor join the CSA. Some of these humans were physically enslaved in an unprofitable and oppressive union of serfdom and incarceration. (Why pay humans to guard the humans working your land, when you could just pay the working humans directly? Guards cost more than farmers because of the riskier job, and you need about as many or maybe more.) The entire debacle was a sludge pit of immoral decisions, which is no foundation to build any government nor society.) What about the 2060s? - 2021
1. So much junk that you need more trunk. - 2021 (That person has too much junk for my trunk.)
1. Social influence falls off at an inverse square of degrees of separation. Influence = 1/Degrees+1. You have full influence (1/1) over yourself at the 'zeroeth' degree, like 50% influence over 1st degree friends, 25% influence over 2nd degree friends of friends, 12.5% (1/4) over 3rd degree relations, 6.25% over 4th, 3.125% over 5th, 1.5625% (1/7) over 6th, and 0.78125% over 7th (when we reach that level of social complexity). - 2017
1. Social media sock puppet masters, constantly browbeating everyone with new information, and selling this cruelty to their friends and neighbors as a virtue. - 2024
1. Social Media, the 'salons of our age, where Thought Leaders exchange Important Ideas', are Validation Casinos, where we pay in comments and payout in upvotes. - 2020 (Imgur's tutorial literally instructs new users to find a specific downvoted post and downvote it again, as a rite of passage - this is also training the user to play 'upvote/downvote', and continue downvoting things that already have downvotes without critical thinking about the post.)
1. Social networks are in the same boat as TV news, needing to sell discontent to users, so those users can be resold for sharply decreasing ad revenues. Have we hit the changeover from banners to influencers & bake-in? - 2022
1. Socialism is usually a response to a lack of funding. The less we have, the more we share. Selfishness complicates scaling this beyond a family unit or small party. - 2022
1. Socialism wasn't Chinese enough for North China's CCP. They wanted 'socialism with Chinese characteristics' aka fit with one-party rule, which wasn't Socialism but State Capitalism. Likewise, cooperative international space exploration isn't Chinese enough - they want State Capitalism In Space. - 2021 (Has every implementation of communism been tied with one-party rule? Have there been any multi-party communist systems?) 
1. Sociology is an emergent phenomenon of grouped humans. - 2023
1. Sock puppets were normalized by the LGBTQ+ community's highly toxic online interactions, and the heavy use of sock puppet accounts to evade acccount bans. This is because community members have to use account blocks for safety, and so get used to using these heavy-handed tools for lesser offenses like being rude, then their counterpart creates another account to continue the discussion. Community members are constantly overshadowing and dismissing whole swaths of the community, from misandrist lesbians to misogynic gays to monogamy-hating polyamorists to transsexuals jealous of other transsexuals who 'pass better' than them, forcing other community members to rally against the dismissive group (which is sometimes the majority of the community,) for awareness and recognition. [Some](https://www.reddit.com/r/honesttransgender/comments/15ixqw2/i_really_really_really_dislike_the_trans_and/) call community interactions an 'Oppression Olympics'. - 2024
1. Software developers are people who show up in the late morning, humble-brag in scrums, spend their days fighting pizza fueled Nerf wars, posting cat gifs and controversial opinions, playing ping pong and Rocket League, and maybe have a screen share with a coworker while staring at a few lines of code in the afternoon - the chat won't be about the code. No stress no hurry no deadlines no shipping no commitment - just high five their scrum manager before lunch and all is good. After a free massage, they sprinkle a few hopeful words onto the hourly contractors that share the floor, and abscond to happy hour. Developing software is the last thing that they do. I am not a software developer because I only develop software, and have abstracted away all of this nonsense. - 2024 (This is taking ownership of Imposter Syndrome, and understanding the disparity I've been feeling throughout my career.)
1. Solutions Architecture is just Bannering in different fields. - 2023
1. Sometimes, all you can do is shake your fist at the sky. - 2005
1. Sometimes, customers cost a business more than they pay. 
1. Sony Lemma Tina - What are the meaning and origin? Frere Jaques 'sonnez le matines' `ring the mornings` - (morining bells, based on the English version 'morning bells are ringing'.) - 2023
1. Sooner is cheaper than later. Or more profitable, referencing the time value of money. - 2021
1. Sound is a longitudinal wave in 1 medium, light is transverse waves in 2 media at a right angle to each other, and gravitational waves are transverse waves in one medium at right angles to itself - as stretching then squashing.
1. Sound Transit 3 (ST3) light rail will cost $54 billion across 25 years - for the same amount, we could put 1 WA State resident on the moon, or build 5.4 space telescopes and place them into L2 orbit. Or build 500 miles of interstate highway. Or 50,000 units of free housing per year at a cost of $40,000 per unit. It's a boondoggle that will only serve about 4% of the region's drivers, and regional judges have ruled it unconstutitional to not complete. - 2021-2024
1. SpaceX's landing pad is (was?) close enough to Blue Origin's offices that BO needs to take a day off for SpaceX to land. - 2018 (Has this changed since 2018?)
1. Speed of light is the 'speed of sound' (speed of vibration propagation) of the electric and magnetic fields. And gravitational fields - how does every field have the same propagation rate? Even air's propagation rate varies with temperature, necessitating leaving large instruments (pianos) on site for weeks in advance, then be tuned, to remain in tune for the performance. - 2022
1. Spin twice to return to the original state - is spin once the antiparticle? - 2023
1. Spintazer - spinfusor that tazers instead of exploding. - 2019
1. Split ends - hair has a smooth exterior, made smoother by oils. Split ends are broken hair, basically cut by probability, and so by definition have a rough surface. These rough surfaces can interlock with other rough surfaces much more easily than the smooth in-lifespan hair, and often create a 'loop' of hair. 
1. Splitting hares is like breaking bread. - 2021
1. Spoiled Borat. - 2020
1. Stakeholder Capitalism is just another name for Charity. - 2023
1. Starship Enterprise was a 24th century castle, but with terrible weaponry. (Mariott convention center lol) - 2020
1. Startup incubators sell a person's dreams back to them. They're a shovel factory for affluent daydreamers, in the same way that some universities are daycares for affuent high school graduates.
1. Steal like an artist - buy/borrow/take/liberate/'nationalize', but most importantly, move on. And make a lot of your own stuff too, for others to steal, so it's more fair. (Be prolific)
1. Steam (Valve) is a package manager and store that takes 30% of every game you buy to sit in your tray and advertise at you. - 2023
1. Steampunk is a past where technology is a friend. Cyberpunk is a future where technology is an enemy. - 2020
1. Stephen Strange Syndrome - having such high skill levels in so many areas that most people can't provide more assistance than you can do yourself, and so can only provide malassistance.
1. Sticks and stones might only break my bones, but certain words will ensure I never eat again. - 2023
1. Stop solving problems you don't have. - 2019. Stop letting other people give you their problems for free. - 2023
1. Storing energy in the form of a question? - 2021
1. Stratify, stratify. (Paraphrase of Thoreau. Dunbar's number management through classism.) - 2014
1. Study science and engineering in your 20s, art history in your 30s, & geopolitics in your 40s. - 2021
1. Stunt-driven story - stunts occur and characters/plot points are written to connect them. (This is Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible franchise.)
1. Stupidity is exhausting because it means doing everything the hard way, and sometimes twice or more. - 2023
1. Subluminal subliminal - a message traveling slower than the speed of light, but faster than average human awareness.
1. Subscreen is what sailors use to prevent subburn.
1. Sunlight is actually a terrible disinfectant, and greatly encourages bacteria growth.
1. Super-dehydrangia (go drink some water)- 2023
1. Supersize your nothing burger. - 2020
1. Supporting the draft, but the draft from a window, not a government draft. - 2024
1. Suspend your disbelief from the ceiling. - 2024
1. Symbolic Links (symlinks) are the file system version of byRef instead of byVal. - 2024

### T

1. T-Rex had arms solely for male-male combat, because they would perform the male combat mating display by chest-bumping each other and flailing with their sharp claws against the other's chest, until one admitted defeat. (from YDAW? Also this sounds like Dino Sumo.) Hunting was entirely different: chasing prey jaws-first. (Is the mating display always so different from an interspecies hunting attack? Also, is this supported by dimorphism on female claws? Or did the females also chest-bump to fight over resources?) - 2022
1. Talking about the x-direction is an x-position exposition. - 2022
1. Tankie = a person so authoritarian that they would literally send a tank to run you over if they don't like what you're doing. - 2023
1. Taoist toast the summation of Creation.
1. Tazer - EMP that disables humans. (We heal quickly so it's only temporary. Needs to pierce the thin inert skin and enter any 2 saline packets.)
1. Teach just enough to make them into good customers.
1. Team Luncheon - 'Let's get our lunch on!' - 2017
1. Team Trash Panda - We take only the best of the worst. (While playing Roblox Energy Assault.) - 2022
1. Tech companies are Ponzi schemes until the investors force management to stumble in the general direction of profitability. Most give up after barely reaching Advertising, not even trying to reach Value-Add or partnering with other tech companies to Assemble Components.
1. Tech is equal parts automation and abeyance. (Scale what you can, ignore what you cannot, and have the wisdom to know the difference?)- 2023
1. Thank you for putting up with me. - 2023
1. The 4 basic colors are CMYK as Carbon (and Nitrogen), Manganese, Yttrium, Potassium (and Chlorine aka black salt)
1. The Algorithm becomes one of your 5 friends. How does this affect you - formally, contextually, emotionally? (You're the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.)
1. The American Flying Fork is stupid, and we should learn to cut with our left hands. - 1993 (The author hs been using the 'Reverse European' eating style since the 1990s, holding the fork with his right hand and cutting with his left hand.)
1. The apple falls downwind from the tree. How far it falls depends on the strength of the wind and the slope of the ground. (Or at least the pine cone does, at windy Ft Spokane. One large tree will have a grove of smaller trees fanned out in a triangle downwind from it.)
1. The cabal - of global politicians, corporate elites, and A-list celebrities - who collectively run the world. They're more of a cliquey cohort, struggling for each other's validation, than a council of guidance and control. - 2022
1. The cure for my own toxicity is the beauty and passion that lay within other people. - 2017.
1. The Devil (nee Loki) is the Joker & the Thief is Yeshua. (Matthew 24:43)
1. The enemy of my enemy is still probably my enemy, but they might be useful against each other.
1. The far end of the Columbian Expansion was the Obesity Crisis. - 2019
1. The first is the greatest. - 2019
1. The first one to back down from a retail conflict.
1. The Friend Zone is for loading and unloading of junk trunk only. Do not park your relationship in the Friend Zone. - 2024
1. The Giving Stone - the more of it that you give away, the more of it that you have to give away. - 2024
1. The hammer is the gas pedal. I want to put the hammer down. - 2021
1. The head looks where the neck turns - MBFGW - The referee looks where the ball is going. - Sportsball tactic to get a penalty assigned to the other team - throw the ball at the penalty so the officials can't ignore it.
1. The hills have eyes, but only for you. (Valentine's day horror movie) - 2018
1. The Immortal Hero Dies is a tired trope, like an emotional jumpscare.
1. The Internet is a series of tubes, and each tube is full of cats. 
1. The Internet is not the real world - it's like a weird Roblox IRL Simulator.
1. The journey is the worthier part. It's about becoming, and never peaking by never quite being, by always shifting the goal posts just one step beyond where you are right now. This keeps you on The Climb, always hungry for a new power progression to overcome. And keeps you in the flux of the apprentice and out of the toxicity of the master.
1. The Judge is The House, and The House (almost) always wins. If The House doesn't always win, then it's a charity and not a business. (Is this true?)- 2023
1. The language of the unspoken word. - 2023
1. The Left is out here creating new corners to paint itself into. Having to specify that someone is the 'first female princess', to differentiate from the 'first male princess', 'first female prince', and 'first male prince'. Because both creating new checkboxes and checking every checkbox are core to their ideology, they can never run out of ways to be offended by everyone, including each other. In this way, they become a snake eating its own tail.
1. The Left making mountains out of mole hills, so they can be 'the first XYZ to brave the summit of Mt Mole.' They sound like old gearheads, trying to make their bog-standard car sound unique and special - 'They made 100,000 of these, but only 10% were red, and only 5% were stick shift. So this is one in 5000. Most of them probably aren't still on the road. This one might be the only one.' - 2024
1. The light and joy within you is the cure for the darkness within me. - 2017
1. The Matrix - The Oracle's job was to help The Machines bridge the uncanny valley. The first Matrix was too perfect, and humans rejected this Eden - even the current Matrix can only survive for about 100 years before sufficient counter-culture develops to effectively counter The Machines. (What does that say for the Bible parallel - were Adam and Eve the ones who really lit Eden ablaze? Maybe Prometheus met them there? Or Lilith after she met Prometheus?) The Oracle's understanding of humanity ultimately led to her joining their side - indeed she's able to process the patterns from human input so well that she can calculate which of her inputs into a given human will produce a given output. She can operate humans the way humans operate a car, something that makes her unique among The Machines.
1. 'The meek shall inherit the Earth' sounds like something you tell the meek so they don't rise up in active rebellion, and become a pitchfork-wielding mob. - 1998
1. The megacorps stopped being evil in 2017 with ESG and DEI, and by 2023 they were too insolvent to cover the entire market.
1. The more often you do it, the less of it you do. Automate everything.
1. The most important part of a remote work setting is a manager who knows how to manage by metrics and not by sight. - 2019
1. The Mountain - That we all live on The Mountain of life, and some live further uphill than others. Some dedicate themselves to The Climb, working to improve their self and status through education, employment, or other investments of time and their money. While others look forward to going downhill because life gets easier for a little bit, while going downhill. Then they stop descending and life difficulty reasserts itself, but without the amenities. Having a cabin in the woods or a loft in the sky are both equal on The Mountain, in that both are the same: having a grand home. And sometimes that's a trailer off the highway, which is extremely attainable. Attainability has a grandness of its own. - 2018
1. The Nelson-Gainer marriage is expecting a son - he'll be a half-Gainer and half-Nelson. - 2024 (A natural athelete.)
1. The new, more fuel efficient hybrid DeLorean time travels at just 66 MPH. - 2021
1. The older someone is, the more life events they have had which need investigation, proportionately reducing their chances for getting US Secret Clearance. This is a form of ageism. Likewise older companies and projects have more project history and environment to investigate. - 2021
1. The One Man Who Could is an Authoritarian trope. (See Great Man Theory)
1. The only people who care about pronouns are the ones looking to attack you for any reason, because they like to attack peope and pronouns have proved to be an 'infinite well' of insults.
1. The Patriarchy are the people who believe in Great Man Theory, that society is largely progressed by Great Men. The Matriarchy are the people who believe that Behind every Great Man is a Great Woman. - 2024 (What are called the people who believe in both, as a kind of Yin and Yang, each driving the other? We need both halves for a functional society, and arguing over which is better is illogical. It's like arguing about a forest being better than an ocean, then arguing that we should have only forests and no oceans.)
1. The people who do not wish to be merely a number, number in the billions.
1. The person who does not take risks, only drinks champagne. - Russian proverb.
1. The point of mosquito spray is to repel insects through a scent that they hate and we either like or can't smell. Spraying on the cothes usually works the best - unlike sunscreen, there's no point to get it on the skin, and it lasts longer when it's not mixing with sweat and oils and flaking away. - 2018 - Mosquito sprays can dissolve plastic, and this is why they conflict with sunscreen - modern sunscreen is an acrylic spray that blocks UV light but not visible light, forming a plastic on our skin. And the mosquito spray eats away at this. - 2024
1. The pot calling the grass green. - 2017
1. The primary cause of heart disease is coronary artery disease. Diet and exercise have proven to be the most effective way to address this disease. - 2016
1. The problem with being psychic is nobody tells you what they mean - they expect you to climb into their head and see for yourself. - 2017
1. The process for making biodiesel is basically the same as making soap, but with methanol added. - 2018
1. The process of 'construct a factory factory factory inside a JVM inside a container inside a VM inside a cloud host' isn't state-of-the-art website hosting, but state-of-the-art job security. - 2023
1. The profit motive is the easiest motive to trust, because it's so well understood and documented. It causes people to be 'evil' (self-centered and narcissistic), in very well-known and predictable ways which can be prepared for or worked around. Assuming people are seeking profit is like assuming gravity pulls objects towards large masses, in the level of predictability. The documentation extends back for millennia and is highly consistent. This almost certain predictability is much preferred to less-consistent ideologies. (The devil you know.)
1. The role of advertising in generating narratives in a capitalist society.
1. The studio doesn't have nostalgia for the artwork, merely nostalgia for its revenue stream. - regarding Disney et al in 2023
1. The study of the flow of people through an area. - 2004
1. The sweet spot of the hockey stick. The point where the performance-price hyperbola's 2nd derivative is maximized.
1. The US Military can control what happens with its weapons, to some extent. We should continue upgrading our weaponry to be more safe, and to only work on approved targets, through GPS and other means. This will provide us with better control over our weaponry on the global stage, and prevent unnecessary loss of life from unintentional use.
1. The US State Dept doesn't enjoy the CIA putting spies into foreign embassies and using diplomatic cover, because every CIA spy means one fewer diplomat.
1. The USA is unique in having histories written by both winners and losers. - 2024
1. The vast application of time and space is the best way to prevent any conflict between 2 people. They'll have trouble finding the ability to conflict if you put 10 light years and 10 million years between them. - 2015
1. The way to have your cake and eat it too - is to start with 2 cakes. - 2015 - The easiest way to start with 2 cakes is to lie about the other one. - 2020 (This comes from old Tom Leykis advice on how to impress and date the gullible: take an attractive person on a nice date in your lame car, and say that your expensive car is in the shop. Name a shop that works on that type of car. (Prepare these lies in advance.) Then say that your expensive house is being repaired, and drive past someone else's expensive house to show the repairs. Say that you're staying in a crummy apartment during the repairs, and use that excuse to bring them to your crummy apartment for the night.)
1. The way to herd kittens is with tuna. - Unknown, 2007
1. 'The wheel will lift you up, and the wheel will pull you down. Wait for the wheel.' - Farscape (Somewhere used to have these 'water-ferris wheels' mounted to docks, and the bottom 1/4 was underwater - also like a water wheel with seats. As the wheel was spun, you'd be pulled under the water and back up - dangerously unsafe ancient summertime recreation.) - 2013
1. The whole point of a Crow's Nest on old ships was to take advantage of Earth's spheroid nature, where being higher up lets you see more of the sphere. Were the Earth flat, Crow's Nests would be pointless on the open sea.
1. The whole point of diversity is not to get two of every Pokemon onto your Ark, but to not restrict yourself from hiring the best because of their arbitrary attributes.
1. The whole point of keeping a corporate change log and having Change Requests and Change Approvers - in theory - is so you could 'replay' your data center from a known snapshot, like SQL transaction log or a commit history. Any change to any system should be recorded, so it can be performed again later - either to rebuild this system, build a future system, troubleshoot, et cetera. This breaks down when human laziness omits 'small' changes from the reporting system. Or when the change management cadence is too long - at a previous employer, we would email specs to our cloud host, and they would manually build the system, often with too many NICs. Removing the excess NICs required a change approver's sign-off from the weekly meeting. So each configuration error added a week to the build time. Change management merges perfectly with configuration management at the intersection of infrastructure as code, where any change must be approved as part of the commit process. This merges development and change processes while removing the 'small change' category - increasing your flexibility through the tighter feedback loop, increasing security through recording all changes, reducing costs & complexity through reducing operations administration needs. This is the same mix of benefits as seen through cloud-native architecture, and these should pair nicely.
1. The world can't run out of sand, since it's made from the stuff. Sand are rocks with volume between 1 mm^3^ and 1.6 mm^3^. This would be like the ocean running out of water, or the Universe running out of space.
1. Theory: Impact Wrench Theory of Engineer Management: Putting an engineer under pressure causes them to solve more problems faster, and maybe more creatively. Stress v pressure - Pressure enables this, while stress hinders it. - 2013
1. Theory: More Swords than Grain theory of Civilization Collapse: If someone has more weapons than food, they'll use the weapons to take more food from others. Money counts as food, not weaponry, but can be traded for weaponry. - 2022
1. Theory: Occupation Theory of Law Enforcement: If someone has a job to goto in the morning, it greatly reduces the chances that they'll stay up at night to steal TVs. - 2015
1. Therapy can help you recover from a severe injury and get back on your feet again. But if you want to seriously compete, you'll have to train, which is different from therapy. Physical and mental. - 2021
1. There are more future states than past states in the time direction, so entropy causes us to propagate in that direction, which is why time moves forward. (Time moves in the Time Direction.) Time moves at the rate it does because it's us moving through spacetime at the maximum propagation rate of lightspeed. We're made out of universe, so we can't leave the universe (or travel faster than propagation) the way that Boardwalk can't leave a Monopoly Board or pass Go. To do so, we'd have to create a bubble of universe around us - like cutting the Monopoly board and putting it on a small plate, then moving this around. Visiting other universes would be like cutting a space from a Rubik's cube and adding Boardwalk - many things including basic physics assumptions might be incongruent, such as the other universe having 2-polar gravity with anti-gravity elements that resist clumping, not having the magnetic field paired to the electric field, or having another dimension of spatial freedom. - 2023
1. There are no imaginary numbers in 'te^am^', which could be rewritten 'seconds * ln (years * meters)' as a rate of acceleration. Does this mean teams don't exist on the complex plane? - 2022
1. There are no skeletons in my closet, only terrifying angels and beautiful demons. - 2019
1. There Is No Conspiracy, and All Conspiracies Are True. Not one big overlord conspiracy controlling everything - there are dozens of big conspiracies and thousands of small conspiracies, each of them operating independently and sometimes getting in each others way. Most of them don't want to merge. Some have monetized into corporations as well, and others control parts of media or major assets - a high-rise office complex in a major city, a painting collection, a highly-licensed patent set, a private island, or a multi-billion dollar charity. Secrecy jurisdictions (and unaudited smaller 'charities in name only') are their bank accounts and the MIB (Military Intelligence Board) are among their police. Bohemian Grove is a common vacation destination, partly because it's a pretty campsite. - 2022
1. There is nothing wrong with your television set - and if there is, we didn't cause it. (Paraphrase of The Outer Limits opening to limit their liability.)
1. There is the concept that humans are illogical and operate based on illogical emotions. But then how did humans develop logic to compare to our emotions and find the latter illogical? Power corrupts, but people have different types and levels of corruption, and a goal for human governance is for the least-corruptible to have power. And as corporate governance is a type of human governance, so too should corporations seek leaders who are highly resistent to corruption.
1. There's less time in a gravity well because all of the matter gets in its way. Steeper gravity wells are compressing more matter into less space, and black holes are when matter is occupying all available space, and there's no space for time. This is to say that the current section of time (aka 'now') traverses more units of space in some areas than in others.
1. TherMOMeter
1. They act like me putting myself first is wrong because doing so also benefits someone that they don't like. This is basically 'If you keep hitting yourself, I'll be your friend.' - 2023
1. Things remain mostly the same. How we perceive things changing tells us much about how we, ourselves, are changing. - 2006
1. Things should either be always too large, or always too small. Avoid things which are both too big AND too small. - 2021
1. Thomas Sowell accidentally makes a great point: 30 year olds are more mature than 70 year olds because the former haven't surrounded themselves with (as many) yes-people yet. (Think of young Michael Jackson vs older.)
1. Those who can, should, for others cannot. (Should they?) The real power lay not in being able to do something, but in gatekeeping - deciding whether or not it should be done. -2020
1. Time Being's name is Nick, which is why people say 'the Nick of Time'. Sometimes people do things for the Time Being, and they say 'For the Time Being...' - 2020
1. Time travel has been theoretically demonstrated, but not quite proven, and consumes enormous amounts of 'inverted energy' which has also been theoretically demonstrated, but not quite proven.
1. Time travel with vegetables and the Flux-Capacipotato!
1. Time-driven story: An event will happen on tick N and characters act, usually with no other events happening. - 2024
1. To recognize that everyone sees me as a walking dollar sign. I don't know where the buck stops, but this is where it departs from.
1. Tokyo attacked by a giant peacock. (NBC launches their app in Japan.) - 2022
1. Tom Waits for Gal Gadot. - 2019
1. Too impatient to be stubborn. - 2021
1. Tracked Maglev - Maglev track is mounted to individual continuous (tank) treads, so the vehicle would be magnetically suspended between the continuous tracks, while the magnetic fields also propel the vehicle forward on the tracks, which pushes the tracks forward across land. (And across water with floating treads.) (Like a tank is a train running on continuous tracks.)
1. Tragedy means it has a sad ending.
1. Training is very specific damage and regrowth. - 2019
1. Transsexual athletes - transsexual female athletes have decades of natural testosterone therapy, and should be put into a different competition class based on this biology. Likewise, transsexual male athletes could be put into a low-testosterone category. - 2021
1. Transsexuality is a medical process of changing your physical body to match your mental body and correct severe body dysphoria. Transgender is a way of robbing transsexual people of sympathy by lying to others about your mental body, and involves no medical processes, only social disruption. Medical doctors do not transition people to 'they' or 'xe' because there is no medical guidance for the genetalia associated with these pronouns - medical transitions are only M2F or F2M. In this way, transgender people harm transsexual people, and thus identifying as transgender is identifying as anti-transsexual. Pronouns are harmful both in normalizing and allying yourself with this type of lying. And some crossdressing homosexuals try to entrap straight people into a relationship - this was the plot to The Crying Game. - 2023 - Like a person 'identifying as disabled' and demanding to use the reserved parking slots, 'for represenatation, because able-bodied people should be more aware of disabled people' despite this person also being able-bodied. And judges go along with this because they're afraid that the person won't be their friend, or their judge-friends won't agree, or otherwise prioritize peer pressure above the needs of the jurisdiction. - 2024
1. Trees are a series of extremly long and narrow capillary tubes between cells. (NileRed) - Water isn't pulled up by plant cells, but by surface tension, cohesion, and adhesion, causing the water to curve up a surface. With a small enough tube, there is no base level, just water curving up the sides - and this becomes a continuous flow through the tube - from root to branch tip. Water is forced into leaves so it will spray out of them, to try and force carbon dioxide into the leaf. Deciduous trees don't necessarily remain alive through winter, so much as they leave something akin to a seed packet in the branch tips, and expect that water will continue to flow through the capillary tubes in the spring. - 2021 (How much of trees breaking in the winter is due to the capillary water freezing?)
1. Tripartite Christian deity is some guy, his kid, and their pet pigeon in a cloak of invisibility. - 2021
1. Trolls might have an aperitiefling before dinner. - 2020
1. Truckheads operate LED-bedazzled combustion-powered pipe organ sexual vibrators (on metal sleds, or trucks too lifted to tow) that produce uselessly massive torque (Dodge Charger) as a side effect. - 2021
1. Truth is stranger than fiction - if you want strange, why read fiction? Goto fiction when you want normalcy. - 2022
1. Trying to maintain a Center somewhere between the horseshoe-extremes of Authoritarian Racism and Forced Diversity.
1. Trying to save money has been the most expensive thing I've ever done. Much cheaper is trying to meet my needs and explore different parts of the market. - 2021
1. Trying to save money is very different from exploring different areas of the market. The former has been one of the most expensive things done by the author, while the latter has been a great source of frugality. - 2024
1. Turn off content which is only discontent. - 2020
1. Two, in three dimensions, is eight. - 2021

### U

1. Ukranium - uranium from Ukraine. - 2022
1. Understanding the motives and objectives of a villain or criminal doesn't absolve them of their crimes or remove the need (both for them and for the rest of society) for punishment to be administered. Someone stealing bread etc means there are 2 problems: someone stealing AND someone starving. Both of these need to be addressed through existing means. 
1. Undying Undine
1. Unlike the Hollywood concept of drugs hurting kids directly, through getting hooked - drugs hurt kids indirectly much more, by stealing our acting and music stars, and depriving whole generations of our most gifted artists. - 2024
1. Using a periodic table to describe the elements of a field usually doesn't make sense as the elements in most fields don't include an inherent periodic parameter, - such as electron shell diameter, which grows as you go left then jumps smaller at the periodic break.

### V

1. Vegetables of the Holy Spirit
1. Velocity is speed in a direction. 60 MPH is a speed, and 60 MPH towards Spokane is a velocity.
1. Videogame mirrors are an 'unsolved problem' - but how can such a simple problem go unsolved? Put another camera behind the mirror, have move parallel the the player along the middle of the mirror, and project what it sees on the mirror. Or another way, make it into a clipped window that's flipped around its vertical axis. Like the portals in Portal, where you put 2 portals next to each other and can see yourself - literally that but directly in front of the player, and clipped so you can't walk through it.
1. Vidjae is plural for vidja.
1. Visual cortex as a reverse video card, to separate inputs into patterns of light and dark, which become assembled into logical objects. - 2023
1. VOIP calls aren't an audio connection between users, but 333 MP3s of duration 300 ms recorded every second (or another similar division), transferred, and played for the listeners. - 2016 - This is not unlike recording a tape full of thoughts, and mailing them to a friend across the country, as some did to avoid high long distance phone rates in the 20th Century. The major innovation is making each recording about 300x shorter - 300 ms instead of 90,000 ms. - 2024 
1. VR lenticular lenses turn sunlight into a deadly laser beam, focused into a fine point on the VR goggle screen. - 2023
1. Vulcans are Mensa and Klingons are Vikings. Anyone can join them, just learn their language and move to their solar system. Ferengi are British, between the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority / Ferengi Commerce Authority), the constant rain on the home world/island, and overzealous capitalism where everything is for sale and the monarch is the one who owns the most stuff. And anyone who can buy their way in can join them. When the going gets tough, the tough go Viking/Klingon.

### W

1. Waffle Neutral - diametric opposite of Lawful Stupid. - 2021 (This is open content and not tied to any specific game system.)
1. Wands in Wizarding UK serve the same role as Thor's hammer, and Naruto's 'dot in the middle of his hand' during Sharingan training - to focus the user's powers into a useful form. (How do you focus your powers into a useful form?)
1. Want more time in your life? Watch a kettle of water boil. Want to live forever? Get a job testing kettles. (You might not actually live forever, but you'll sure feel like it.) - 2021
1. Wanting to remove pain/discomfort, even in oneself, is a sign of compassion.
1. War as a series of burned bridges.

1. Was One Punch Man minmaxed into a glass cannon?- 2023
1. Water beds must be heated to be used, or else they become too cold to be slept on, pulling heat out of the body. (Might be good in tropical weather?) So can't be used during power outages. - 2003 (Or in off-grid situations.)
1. Water isn't really H2O, but a mixture of hydroxide (OH-) and hydronium (H3O+), with the oxygen atoms moving back and forth between molecules, as a function of temperature. The Sour Taste Bud directly detects hydronium. and since there's more of both hydroxide and hydronium when water is hotter, this is how we can taste the temperature of water. - 2023
1. Watermelon Man's name is Urizane. (from sCRYed)
1. Wave-particle duality is actually wave function - wave location duality.
1. We are all alone, but you can be alone with me, at least for a little while. My Blank Space spans Half The Sky and my domain includes all that the moonlight touches.
1. We are all going to die - slowly, one at a time, across many decades.
1. We are each a shallow pond, an oasis in the desert of the cold and unfeeling interstellar wilderness. The universe is a cold and lonely place, but we are also made of the universe, and we can make parts of it warm and welcoming.
1. We are each the wrong person, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, doing the wrong thing, to the wrong people, for the wrong reasons. Don't let (the forces freeing you from that with which doesn't harmonize with you) limit you. - 2017.
1. We are the electromagnetic force, suspended between saline packets of self-expanding lipid-polymer foam, floating along geodesics in 4d spacetime near large gravity masses, navigating a sociopolitical maze of ever-increasing complexity, just trying to get along. - 2018
1. We are the gears that make our world go around. - 2019 - If one of us doesn't do it, then it simply goes undone.

1. We can be bitter, or we can be better. - 2022
1. We cannot go back(wards in time), but we can go anywhere again.  - 2020 (Will we ever go to Washtucna again and see that bus?)
1. We don't see through our eyes - our eyes are the inputs to a visual conversion 2d-to-3d neural network, and the 3d world we experience is the output. Objects always appear to be composed of Platonic solids because that's how our neural networks compose 3d objects - compositing objects from adding and subtracting simpler objects such as Platonic solids. And there might be things that our neural networks are trained to not pass on to us (They Live). Some neural networks hallucinate (schizophrenia). Some neural networks fail to find viable models of the patterns of their inputs (autism). - 2024
1. We don't see through our eyes, so much as our eyes are inputs into an image generation neural network as part of our brain, and we're basically viewing its output. - 2024
1. We enjoy narrative straight lines, but reality is based much more in narrative waves, as most people live a random walk between optimal states.
1. We have this sword here, to protect us from bandits. But it's made from uranium among other metals, so it's slowly killing us. Is it better than the bandits? - 2023
1. We live in 'the gap', a Goldilocks-like zone between the Rock of Not Enough and Hard Place of Too Much.
1. We may lose, ..., but we'll never be here again. (Paraphrase Edit of Eagles, Take It Easy. We aren't going to win - there will be no winning involved, just more loss or less. The locals won't even remember an easy win against some vainglorious loser on a random Taco Tuesday.)
1. We-a-pwn
1. We're losing technologies in the fields of videogame development and forest fighting, among others.
1. We've got spirit yes we do - but it's more like a Spirit Halloween than a high school pep rally.
1. Wealth is Owner's Equity in one's personal life. The opposite of equity is debt, and the opposite of wealth is poverty. (Otherwise, 'wealth' means 'a lot of something'.) - 2005 (This is why 'Social Equity' `own society` groups don't make any sense - because their goals are merely those of an comic book villain - world domination.)
1. Werewolf is past tense of Iswolf. - 2022
1. What does cyanide smell like? Info websites will lie to you that it smells like almonds - because they conflate the 2 kinds of almonds instead of explaining that hydrogen cyanide (HCN) smells like bitter almonds, because those nuts contain a compound that breaks down into hydrogen cyanide - so basically they're saying that cyanide smells like cyanide, a tautology. But nobody eats bitter almonds, and you've probably only ever eaten sweet almonds. So when these websites say that cyanide smells like almonds, they're being so reductive that they're disingenuous. - 2019
1. What dressing do you like on your word salad? - 2023
1. What is a society's legal recourse when its judges are captured by out-sympathying each other, and rule against the society in an attempt to seem more liberal than their peers? - 2024
1. What makes a computer tick? The computer's clock makes it tick. Kernels are the base-level programs that run on (micro)processors. The difference between a simple kernel and a full OS is like the difference between an application and a web browser - make (application programming) interfaces to load other software into local memory and give them compute time on your CPUs.
1. What to get someone for Christmas when what they really enjoy is to brag about having extended arguments with random people over unimportant matters? - 2021 (Maybe a lemon-quality product with a great warranty, so they can yell at the store employees?)
1. What you want is not (the thing) - what you want is how you feel about (the thing), and you want someone else to feel that way about you. - 2021
1. Whataboutism is an argumentation tactic, where one party asks a tangential question, with an answer too long for the other party to fully respond in their allotted debate time or post character limit. - 2023
1. When I learned that GOTO was considered harmful, it felt like someone was attacking my lifestyle. - 2022

1. Why buy what you can make? - 2020 (There are many good reasons, such as mass production. Still something to consider.)
1. Why doesn't the NSA provide an MFA app for all US Citizens? Why doesn't the Post Office offer a free email address for every US Citizen? Why doesn't the US Treasury update their archaic website that doesn't allow you to type your password, and instead have to click it from a Javascript keyboard? - 2021
1. Why don't Woke characters use sex as a weapon? - 2023
1. Why drive people crazy when you can make them walk? - 2022

1. Wisdom is to experience, as torque is to horsepower, and CPU APUs are to GFLOPS or TOPS. - 2024
1. With the (uninstall) of the American Dream, so many are looking for a replacement dream. - 2021
1. Woke as being drunk on the dopamine rush from the validation cycle built into Current Year Social Media. - 2023
1. Woke Hollywood is like getting a cheese pizza and asking for pepperoni. SO they take it back and make an all-pepperoni pizza. Pepperoni crust, pepperoni sauce, pepperoni cheese. Oops all pepperoni. Like, no I enjoy crust and cheese and sauce, but just want an extra topping. Can't talk to these entertainment extremists like normal people - they intentionally misunderstand. - 2021
1. Woke is like remaking A Bugs Life with only ladybugs. - 2021
1. Woke is like trying to replace all Fermions with Bosons, 'for representation'. (Because Enrico Fermi was European while Satyenda Nath Bose was Indian.) - 2022

1. You either die the misunderstood villain, or live long enough to see yourself redeemed through others understanding your motivations.
1. You have the right to feel secure in your person and papers. You have the right to associate and not associate with whom you choose.

1. You won't always find all of the puzzle pieces at the same time, in order, or in any sort of linear or logical way. They will come to you as you need them, in the form chosen by the need at the moment when you create them, and you exist to find ways to connect them into a viable existence to sustain your body. Being the right person becomes having been the right person at each formation point, to have formed the correct puzzle pieces to form the correct viable pattern. There are many patterns that could sustain us, but few can sustain us and also sustain our offspring. (Needs slight workshop)- 2023
1. You're not one of those insufferable people, are you? - 2023
1. Your Dinosaurs Are Wrong - and sometimes, Not Even Wrong. - 2022
1. Your fantasy is problematic in that it's based around technically illegal situations, and so we have to check that this isn't a villain fantasy.
