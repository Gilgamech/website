# [04/06/2024](#04062024) - Cook Until Done - Algorithmic Recipes

## Generate a new recipe from 2 or more recipes:

1. Ratio quantities. Some recipes are made to produce 4-6 dozen cookies, while others make just 2 servings of soup. Work backwards from how much you want to make/eat/store/share, then ratio each recipe so it makes that much. (This is like finding common denominators or similar speakers - it's finding common quantiites.)
2. Separate recipes into flavorful and structural elements. Often, a recipe will create a flavor sauce in a solvent-binder water-fat mix, adhere this to a water-soluble starch substrate, then evaporate the water solvent. This describes everything from pasta to rice dishes to quesadillas to grilled cheese sandwiches. This lets these elements be rotated, creating substitutions, like moving a rice-based dish to a pasta substrate for a rice-allergic person, or a potato-substrate to ramen for a fusion treat. (This is like aligning decimal places or putting all of the speakers at the same distance.)
3. Average each flavorful ingredient - take the same ratioed ingredient from each recipe, and average those together. Examine how far that is from each one, and how much you like that flavor. This makes sure that a sufficient amount of the ingredient is in the recipe. (This is like performing math on each column or adjusting speaker volumes to be about the same from the listening location.)
4. Re-ratio flavorful ingredients. This is fine-tuning their ratio to each other, to get the flavor mix and the taste from the final product. 
(This is like summing the columns into the answer, and double-checking it, or adjusting the equalizer.)

At night, it gets a few degrees below freezing. Temperatures here very linearly go up while we're facing the sun, and go down while we're not. So the heater/AC unit's frost prevention system kicks in - display shows FP at like 50 F and turns on the heater for a little bit, so the unit doesn't freeze. The unit brings in external air, and heating it drops its humidity by a huge amount. At night, the air gets so dry that it wakes me up with a dry mouth - and I have to boil a pint of water and drink a pint of water to rehydrate. 
- This room is around 350 ft^2^, with 10 foot ceilings, so around 3500 ft^3^. 
- Previous data suggests that 1 gallon of water in 16,321 gallons (2181 ft^3) of air would be 1% humidity.
