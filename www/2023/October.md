# [10/30/2023](#10302023) - Load a sitelet from anywhere:

## Added a game changing new feature to Sparational.js: 

Load sitelets from any web location, not just your own site. This gives the flexibility to call sitelets from other sites:

https://www.sparational.com/sites/rgb.spa

Only the CSS is missing to make it a fully styled RGB calculator. Likewise, the math calculator is also available:

https://www.sparational.com/sites/calc.spa

This will be the direction for Sparational.js in the future. As well as adding YAML and Markdown as data types.

# [10/29/2023](#10292023) - 3D Printing Business Ideas:

## 3D Printing is in the 'chicken and egg' stage, where it's not needed because it's not used. There are 3 good ways to approach this:

- Pre-printed objects.
  - Right now, if someone needs a comb, or a light switch cover, or a spool, they don't really care how it's made, and don't want to wait for hours after ordering for it to print.
  - The key in succeeding with a pre-printed shop would be predicting market demand, and driving customer awareness of product selection.
  - It might be easier to work with local retailers to sell a few small products first.
- On-demand printing of other peoples designs.
  - This might work either as a mail-order service, or as a pickup and dropoff service.
  - Mail-order can be done from anywhere and would benefit from national or global Internet marketing.
  - Pickup and dropoff would need a storefront location.
- On-demand design and printing .
  - This could work as a delivery service - show up once to measure the piece, and return with the printed piece.
  - Also could work similar to the pickup and dropoff service.

# [10/07/2023](#10072023) - Last time on Dragonball Z:

## Anime and other children's TV shows used to follow a kind of episode arc:

- Remind the audience of all of the exciting events that happened last time.
- Exciting intro plays!
- Characters burn some time waiting for the next plot point
- Other characters reach a plot point.
- Third group kills time until a plot point.
- Exciting outro plays!
- Tease the audience with all of the exciting events that will happen next time.

Normally you'd have an arc where you start with a dry audience, get them excited, go through a story arc, then wind down and end. Here, you shift that 180 degrees and start in the middle with high intensity, bring that through the intro, drop it down for the actual content, then ramp it back up for the outro. This keeps people hungry for something to happen while getting by on scraps of plot from a drawn out manga.
