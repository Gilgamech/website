Statistically, almost every business that Elon Musk runs would become bankrupt, if these secret program UFOs can do what we've seen them do, and if they're powered the way we think they're powered.

- Tesla - obsolete by Tic Tacs.
- SpaceX - obsolete by Tic Tacs.
- StarLink - obsolete by Tic Tacs flying faster than a long-distance network will relay - easier to fly around Earth than Zoom around Earth.
- SolarCity - obsolete by Free Energy Machine that would be needed to supply the megavolts needed to power the propulsion systems.
- Boring Company - already obsolete by other tunneling companies, and also now with extraplanetary travel.
