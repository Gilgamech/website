# [07/10/2022](#07102022) -  If I Were A Rude Boy

Rhianna's art might be evidence of a problem with the Modern world

- In one song (If I Were A Boy) she's singing about how men should be more selfless and gentle.
- In another song (Rude Boy) she's singing about how men should be more selfish and aggressive.

Which does she want? The best of both worlds, with a selfless and gentle man who will take care of her but she doesn't have to deal with his boring gentle love, and a rough lover who will satisfy her but she doesn't have to deal with him being a jerk in public. It's classic indecision, being unable to choose between 2 exclusive choices
