# [05/20/2023](#05202023) - AI experts testify before US Senate.

- Video replay:

- Key points: 
- People shouldn't be tricked into working with an AI when they think they're working with a human.
  - Concerns about one human already being talked into uninstalling themselves. (Call the suicide hotline!)
  - Proposal for a 'Nutrition Facts' label on AI
  - Proposed creating classes to separate small task AI from medium LLMs from much larger AI.
  - Concerns about 'hallucinations' - not just in implicating innocent people in crimes, but also braking for cars that do not exist.
  - Concerns about AI already being able to predict public opinion, and this power getting into the wrong hands.
  - Concerns about AI that are instantly addictive to a given human, and can be trained to be irresistible to specific individuals.
  - Proposal to make AI companies exempt from a Copyright law named 'Section 230', which would make them partially responsible for harm caused by their products.
  - Request for risk-based regulation from industry - saying that AI regulation needs its own government agency, probably an international agency, as a USA-only agency would be pointless and just force dubious AI companies to move elsewhere. Not sure which international agency would enforce this, but a need is there.
  - Proposal to control AI use through GPU export access.
  - ChatGPT gives a balanced response to AI regulation.
  - Concerns about copyrighted material in training data and Creator rights, such as compensation.
  - Senator almost says that OpenAI Jukebox is the new Napster
  - Concerns about voting location misinformation and other election misinformation.
  - 'Trying to figure how AI is different from social media.'
  - 'Section 230 is the wrong tool to use here.'
  - 'Should a license be required to produce some of these tools?' 'For some of them, yes.'
  - License based on capability where possible instead of processing power. (Asked for thresholds:) Able to convince a person, able to design bioweapons, etc.
  - How would a court subpoena the AI's knowledge?
  - Advise on potential privacy laws? Customers should be able to opt out of their data being used by an AI or in training one. How to implement?
  - How to prevent kids from using? Kids get around safeguards so just make it safe. Also these are heavily used in education.
  - Altman: 'We're so short on GPU's that we're better if people don't use ChatGPT.'
  - Analogy to automobiles as new tech, creating numerous federal agencies to regulate cars.
  - Not regulating social media called a mistake.
  - Need agency-growing experts. Also need science to be a key part of regulation - we don't have science terms to describe misinformation and tech to detect it in an AI.
  - 'Are you ever going to offer ads?' 'I really like the subscription model.'
  - 'I'm concerned about the massive tech concentration in Web 2.0 etc.' How to mitigate risks and concerns? 'Open models will be common but very few large players will be able to make the very large AIs. But there's value for consumers in that.'
  - 'There's a risk for technocracy combined with oligarchy where these systems can shape our lives.'
  - Proposal for a public 'alignment' data set, to solve some of these problems.
  - Critical areas: Logging AI output. Medical and psychiatric info and incidental therapy.  Interactions beyond Internet search, such as placing orders. And long term risks such as the impact of very large AI on the world.
  - 'So different levels of manipulating people?' 'Yes - (goes into Counterfeit People article.)
  - 'What to expect when you're expecting GPT4'

# [05/09/2023](#05092023) - Writing prompt.

In this society, only even-numbered elements are used. Odd-numbered elements are considered an abomination and anyone who touches one is unclean. This is because their planet has almost exclusively even-numbered elements and very few odd-numbered ones.

- How does this impact their planet's development and existence?
- What buildings and objects can they build and not build?
- How does this cause conflict with other societies?

# [05/06/2023](#05062023) - Amps and volts.

Electricity as volts and amps, in being pressure and capacity.
