# [05/31/2024](#05312024) - Cook Until Done - Substrate-Binder-Solvent

Hardtack is a foundational food item. Used from Biblical to Frontier times, its deletion from the Space-Age menu is a historical anomaly. It's like a cement cracker, and one of the best survival foods. If you want to live for under $1/day, you'll be making a lot of hardtack. 

Flour contains both polycarbonate substrate (in the form of starch polyglucose) and gluten binder. The gluten is activated by water (solvent), activating the disulfide bonds between the oblate spheroid gliadin ("glee-add-in", or maybe "glee-a-din") and the long poly-protein glutenin. This is how hardtack works - dry the water out so it's just polycarbonate powder held together by binder. This could be used as a building material, but isn't waterproof. 

Fats are plasticizers - the triglyceride arms resemble both phthalate arms and epoxidized soybean oil arms, both of which are widely-used plasticizers. These make the hardtack more flexible and softer - from crackers to tortillas (which have a relatively large amount of lard) without reducing the lifespan too much.

Sugar is usually considered a liquid when baking, and is frequently mixed with liquids and not solids, despite being a solid. Simple sugar is the glucose molecule, and more complex sugars such as sucrose or lactose have another molecule - fructose or galactose respectively - bonded to the glucose molecule. The classification as liquid might have to do with the molecular polarity and high number of bonding locations, making the molecule ideal for polymerization into starch, cellulose, and other storage molecules, for storage or construction. But unlike actual liquids, the sugar's evaporation temperature is above its combustion temperature, so will stay in the food when baked. Adding sugars makes the hardtack softer and sweeter.
