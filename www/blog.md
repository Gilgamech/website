# [06/30/2024](#06302024) - Battery buckets

Constructed a solar system, to enable more-remote work. Solar systems are really 2 systems: Charge and Discharge. This was built with Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) products from Harbor Freight. (These aren't affilliate links and I'm not associated with them.)

- Generator is a [100 Watt folding solar panel](https://www.harborfreight.com/100-watt-solar-panel-briefcase-57991.html).
  - This model is about 17 pounds, and fits easily into a car trunk or back seat. Has integrated stands, handle, and wiring. Comes with cover.
  - This usually charges the battery in around 5 hours of uninterrupted solar input.
- Storage is a 35 Amp-hour / 420 Watt-hour [sealed lead acid (absorbent glass mat) battery](https://www.harborfreight.com/12v-35-ah-sealed-lead-acid-battery-56770.html).
  - 1 laptop and hotspot usually discharges the battery in 4-5 hours. 
- Charge regulation and control is provided by a [7 Amp Charge Regulator](https://www.harborfreight.com/7-amp-solar-charge-regulator-96728.html).
  - It's small and simple, but gets the job done here.
  - Charging a battery by solar is basically the same as charging by wall, from a 7 A charger. 
- Charger wiring is using a 16 AWG extension cable. 
  - The system could operate on wiring provided by the regulator and panel alone, but this gives more flexibiltiy in where to place the panel.
- Inverter Wiring is [3 feet of 2/0 AWG flexible copper cabling](https://www.harborfreight.com/3-ft-20-awg-inverter-cable-set-63748.html).
  - Discharging requires pulling a large current from the battery, and compressing this into a higher mains voltage. This necessitates large and short cabling between inverter and battery.
- Inverter is a [1000 Watt (2000 max) pure sine wave inverter](https://www.harborfreight.com/1000-watt-continuous2000-watt-peak-pure-sine-wave-power-inverter-57273.html), the preferred choice for electronics. 
  - This device has a 5-bar battery meter (driven by output voltage, haven't seen it above 4 bars while on battery) and a 5-bar output meter.
