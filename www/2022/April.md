# [04/17/2022](#04172022) - 3d printed business cards.

The goal is to 3d print 1mm thick business cards, which can be made into a toy. While this trial run wasn't a complete success, it's close enough that further development is inspired. The axle fittings in the wheels were too small, and so were the axle gaps in the body. And the fold hinges joining the body to the sides is too stiff, so it breaks instead of folding well. But these problems can be overcome.

A downside to my <a href="https://www.Gilgamech.com/2021/December.html#12072021">Game Charger laptop bag</a> is that the zipper handles make a loud jingle when it's on my back. So I've made Big G chips, with a slot in the center just smaller than the zipper handle. They fit very snug, and make a quieter plastic jingle instead.

# [04/04/2022](#04042022) - CAD a little, skin a little, animate a little, render a little, print a little.

Work progresses on the door clamp idea. I'm basically moving into it, having to outfit it with every object I would have. So today I made a dishwasher, fridge, and tub, with surround. It feels like each thing I make reminds me to make like 10 more, but I'm building a huge shape and skin cache for future projects. Here's a photo of an intermediate render alongside my coin-sized Big G gear:

# [04/02/2022](#04022022) - Got a 3d printer.

Printed out the logo, and a door clamp. The cat was a demo shape that came with the printer. - it's a hollow shell, with another hollow shell in the middle, and honeycombing between. So that's another thing to learn how to do.s
