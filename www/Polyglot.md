# Polyglot. 
-  Language that transpiles to all other languages. (Support under development.)
-  Written in Markdown.
-  Commands end in periods instead of semicolons or line endings. 
-  Conditionals and loops are separate blocks.
-  Use as few reserved words as possible: Import to bring in external data. Export to send out internal data. Equal/s to equate variables. 
-  All variables defined with ListItem?
-  Module sections defined by headers?
-  Typed? (With type:variable)
-  Supports as many types of comment character as possible. 
-  Caps-insensitive? 
-  Lines ending with commas will ignore clearspace to the next character, and this is encouraged for complex code. 

## FizzBuzz

- input and output equal Import. 
- Fizz equals 3. 
- Buzz equals 5. 

If input modulus Fizz is equal to zero, output equals 'fizz'. 

If input modulus Buzz is equal to zero, If input modulus Fizz is equal to zero, output equals 'fizzbuzz', else output equals 'buzz'.

If input modulus Buzz is equal to zero, 
if input modulus Fizz is equal to zero, 
output equals 'fizzbuzz', 
else output equals 'buzz'.

- Export equals input.
