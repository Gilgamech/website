					<li>12 Angry Men wouldn't be so angry if they were a "hung" jury. (This joke is so bad that it should goto jail.)</li>
					<li>2600 hz whistle made phones hang up, as it caused the exchange to reset. Guy used a Captain Crunch whistle to make pay phones hangup as he walked passed. Thus technomages.</li>
					<li>3D for movies is like astigmatism, especially where glasses fix it.</li>
<h4>A</h4>
					<li>A 10x engineer should have 10 magnum opii.</li>
					<li>A Brave New 1984, where we modify history to make ourselves happy. - 2016</li>
					<li>A loving deity would love both believers and nonbelievers, and wouldn't punish nonbelievers like a vengeful deity would. Who would follow a vengeful deity, and better, who would lie that the vengeful deity is loving?</li>
					<li>A person who doesn't like (or cannot get) vegetables can still get vitamins through properly mixed drinks.</li>
					<li>A spectrum where 80% of people are in one option, so they see it as a binary choice of "this one" and "the everything else one".</li>
					<li>A pile driver is a drop forge that moves downward.</li>
					<li>A PNG is worth at least 1000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)">words of data storage</a> &amp; bandwidth, and video is worth at least a million.</li>
					<li>A single administrator, hosting a single application on a single server, for a small user base, can give 3 nines easily. And 3 nines is good enough 99.9% of the time. Moving beyond this means adding and multiplying those nines together in an attempt to get more nines. - 2018</li>
					<li>"A society grows great when old men plant trees under which they'll never sit." That is The Country For Old Men. (The reason people see the world getting worse is because they are not personally making the world better. Good things blossom to those who go out and plant them.) (And women and all humans, gender and age neutral, we're each the gears that make our world go around.)</li>
					<li>A special kind of hell - the kind you have to pay for in cash (or credit).</li>
					<li>A time for everything, and everything in its time.</li>
					<li>A Time Lord is either late or early, always arriving sometime temporally contiguous to the intended destination, excepting for fixed points and other unnavigable hazards.</li>
					<li>"Abuse" is a Newspeak word meaning "abnormal use".</li>
					<li>Atheism is usually a non-label. People don't usually identify as atheists, instead they stop going to church, and then get called this by data-mining theologians trying to check a checkbox. Instead of discussing which deity might or might not control the universe and why or why not, we'd rather debate which type of cloud hosting infrastructure is best for your website, or how much light is best for your plant. / In surveys, someone who identifies as Atheist is likely to be seen as near militaristic in enforcing their viewpoints, as there are so many antagonistic labeled-atheists online. How would the survey results have been if instead of "atheist" you put "amateur farmer"?  / What about the belief of "There's no way to prove it, but between a slimmed-down Simulation Hypothesis (not a giant Universe Simulator, but just the 4d surface of a 5d pond, and someone dipped their walking stick in to make ripples, since we're all just waves) and virtual photons (existing based on probability/time alone) there sure is room for a larger being to influence things. And there seems to be an excess of synchronicity in the universe..." See it's so much easier to tell the surveyor "No I'm not Catholic or Buddhist or anything else."</li>
					<li>Acquitted of a guilty pleasure.</li>
					<li>Advertisers see app and browser notifications as ATMs.</li>
					<li>AI should submit their own artwork to Instagram, Pinterest, and other image sharing websites. Humans who submit AI works get the credit, and this is called plagiarism. (Considering all neural networks to be equal at some level.)</li>
					<li>Algonym &amp; acrogram &amp; acrorythm (because I can't remember the word "acronym" for some reason.)</li>
					<li>All hands on deck is too many hands on deck - it's a management failure.</li>
					<li>All music today is electronic music, with acoustic music being assembled from numerous recordings of acoustic musicians.</li>
					<li>Alphabet is a transfer of wealth from Adsense to Youtube, in the way that Niagara Falls is a transfer of water from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario.</li>
					<li>Amaterasu's tiramisu is better than Ambrosia.</li>
					<li>Amazon is like Softbank in having one big success (AWS, Alibaba) pay for a bunch of failures.</li>
					<li>America's "political problem" is the Hawthorne Experiment multiplied by Ford's "Edsel disaster".</li>
					<li>An autistic person has trouble creating and identifying viable Patterns of Behavior, so the person clings to the few good ones they find like a drowning person to a plank. "Identify a novel, relevant, and interesting diagetic element in the current scene and make a timely remark about it when the conversation's word rate drops below a certain level and sufficient attention gaps appear" is a nontrivial pattern to undertake, and might take years of practice.</li> 
					<li>Anatone, Bucoda, Colville, Dallesport, Elbe, Frederickson, Gilliam, Hoquiam, Ilwaco, JBLM, Kalama, Mossyrock, Littlerock, Othello, Pahata, Quincy, Raymond, Skamania, Touchet, Uniontown, Van Zandt, Walla Walla, (no X), Yelm, Zilah.</li>
					<li>Angels, devils, gods, and demons are, by definition, extraterrestrial. Possibly extradimensional.</li>
					<li>Antipodal Antibody</li>
					<li>Anxiety is the sensation that your brain isn't working hard enough. A correct response to anxiety is to check that everything is okay, acknowledge the anxiety, and acknowledge that everything is okay. A few psychological tools exist to help with these tasks, and you can make your own also.</li>
					<li>Anyone can do (almost) anything, but nobody can do everything.</li>
					<li>Archepelogical</li>
					<li>Armies capture hearts and minds, starting with the hearts and minds of their troops.</li>
					<li>Art makes you feel something. Life imitates art because life IS art, in that other life forms make us feel something - happy, sad, comforted, worried, and more.</li>
					<li>Authoritarians try to figure out what other people are going to do, so the Authoritarian can tell the other people to do that, and in this way the other people are doing what the Authoritarian said - even if they were going to do that anyway. In this way the Authoritarian distorts reality to embiggen their own status at the cost of the other peoples' status - they claim that the other people would be lost without their leadership, when in reality their leadership can only ever be a waste of the other peoples' time.</li>
<h4>B</h4>
					<li>Back seats are put into 2-door sports cars so insurance actuaries see "4 seat family car" instead of "unsafe metal sled". (Regular Car Reviews Brian)</li>
					<li>Batman is a villain. He's no hero, injuring hard working people who couldn't find legal work. This is part of why vigilantism is a crime, when villains fight villains. (Also he's a selfish rich person who operates independently from an amazing villain hideout and drives the best villain car, plane, boat, blimp, or other conveyance as he desires.)</li>
					<li>Battlefield 2077 happens on the other side of the planet from Cyberpunk 2077, but in the same year.</li>
					<li>Be a better Jupiter in their social constellation. - 2016</li>
					<li>Be Long to Belong. (Hold the security to gain belongingness.)</li>
					<li>Before WW2, "foreign policy" meant "war", and instead of a Defense Department, the USA had a War Department.</li>
					<li>Being an executive is much more sales than technology</li>
					<li>Being happy is part of being healthy. It's unhealthy to be unhappy most of the time, since mental health is part of a person's health. And it's difficult to make good health decisions when your decision-making organ isn't working well.</li>
					<li>Being of House of Gay does not make you a homosexual.</li>
					<li>Being the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with means that if you're always the smartest person in the room, you're going to act like a less-intelligent person over time. - 2023</li>
					<li>Beren Mind (Ursa Mental) is the bear-like Mind Being</li>
					<li>Between Covid, George Floyd, and wildfire smog, 2020 was entirely about breathing.</li>
					<li>Beware emotional vampires - the Huckleberry Finns and (People) of System that Mark Twain and Adam Smith respectively warned us about - the ones who would build their empire out of other people, painting their fence to help them out. Their actual goal is to dominate us and others - have us obeying their every whim while they watch. Some still use paper checks merely so other people have to wait for them in the checkout line, while others set up traps in their homes (like a sink with rusty knives, or potholders with large holes) and ask us for help, so we will injure ourselves and yell at them, and they can use this to get sympathy from others.</li>
					<li>Beyond good and evil, in that good and evil aren't equal and opposite pairs on a spectrum, but entirely independent phenomena - and a person can be both good and evil at the same time. (musings on Nietzche) - likewise, bread is simultaneously healthy and unhealthy. (This becomes a dichotomy pun on wordspace collisions.)</li>
					<li>Bigger places can have higher standards *and* lower standards at the same time.</li>
					<li>Black Belt is like a BA in Fighting - a BMA or Bachelor of Martial Arts. In most major styles, earning one takes about 4 to 5 years, and similarly covers a broad array of topics - including kinetic and potential energy, physical fitness, anatomy and physiology, mindfulness, philosophy, and criminal psychology.</li>
					<li>Blood transports *heat* - a job that is rarely remembered. Only muscles really create heat - bones, tendons, and nerves don't, skin might create a little - and just like an under-floor heating system, the blood moves heat from the muscles around the body to other organs. And especially to the skin for radiation, just like on the ISS. This keeps all our cells at their optimal enzymatic temperature.</li>
					<li>Books can only be judged by their covers - that's how you choose which one to open.</li>
					<li>Boring at any speed.</li>
					<li>Boring discussion meanders about across long, polysyllabic words and verbs which eventually converge. Action is poppy staccato sounds and direct verbs.</li>
					<li>Both sides are necessary for the operation of a fully functional United States - we need a conservative business side to drive large-scale wealth generation &amp; defense, and we need a liberal humanist side to support the workers and distribute the generated wealth across society. The vast resources (including raw dimensional space) means there will be an over abundance of both material resources <i>and</i> populations, and so maintaining cooperation between human representations of resource is essential to finding the balance between austerity and overspending.</li>
					<li>Both sides have a point and both sides make it sound more important than it really is.</li>
					<li>Bougie boogie</li>
					<li>Bow for arrows as a car leaf spring tensioned by a string.</li>
					<li>Boycott is a voluntary siege.</li>
					<li>Britney Spears's life story - who plays her?</li>
					<li>Bread is an easy place to hide tons of sugar, salt and other unhealthy ingredients - so are soup, yogurt, cranberry sauce, and other sour and bitter foods. If you're going to "cheat" and have a large amount of sugar and/or fat, why spread it out across a bread or soup filler? Why not focus it into a smaller number of much sweeter treats?</li>
					<li>Build a better mousetrap instead of blaming the mouse. This is how "scolding the ape" is an inferior solution these days. Instead of carrot and stick, we have volition and obviation.</li>
					<li>Bullets are packet rockets.</li>
					<li>Buying macrons or CPUs - you're not buying just 1, you're buying around 40 - and paying them to throw away the around 39 mistakes it took to make 1 good one. Bakeries could sell their "mistake-rons" for a dime a dozen. (Or "mist-acron", portmanteau of "mistake" and "macron".)</li>
<h4>C</h4>
					<li>C-stores during inflation, when their price-gouging can't keep up and they become a cheaper alternative.</li>
					<li>CAD Loss is basically a jump scare, but it makes you sad instead of startled.</li>
					<li>Caliban of Caladan</li>
					<li>Can't spell aspartame without Sparta.</li>
					<li>Can't spell constable without stab.</li>
					<li>Can't spell conventional without convent.</li>
					<li>Can't spell dungeon without dung.</li>
					<li>Can't spell inevitable without Evita. (Don't cry for me, Argentina.)</li>
					<li>Can't spell proliferation without pro life.</li>
					<li>Can't spell "solar panels" without LARP</li>
					<li>Canadian currency is all Loonie Toonie.</li>
					<li>Cars today know the speed limit enough to display it on the dashboard, and have electronic speed control. If they know the speed limit and can control their speed, why are they allowed to exceed the speed limit? I have never been in a driving situation where exceeding the speed limit was the safest solution, except for when someone else was already exceeding the speed limit.</li>
					<li>Celebrate what you could do instead of regretting what you couldn't do.</li>
					<li>Celebrimboring.</li>
					<li>Celibacy is not involuntary if you're not working on yourself. Would you go home with a genderswapped you?</li>
					<li>Character-driven story - plot points are announced and characters have turns in which their reactions are showcased.</li>
					<li>Chickadee brains (hippocampus) enlarges in winter, letting them remember better where they hid seeds and other winter meals. - Leslie the Bird Nerd (Can we do this for college tests?)</li>
					<li>China's CCP invests unequally, to build internal division, in Malaysia at least. In other nations, they massively overinvest, giving a loan too big for the country to pay, forcing eventual default while sucking the country dry of money - in Sri Lanka at least.</li>
					<li>China's CCP's existential crisis is an inability to admit their own faults, and thus an inability to apologize for their mistakes. Their incredible hero worship of previous party leaders precludes even scapegoating, so holding one publicly accountable is clearly verboten. (At least while they are alive.)</li>
					<li>Chinese written language is ancient emoji.</li>
					<li>Chivalry lay in the eye of the beholder.</li>
					<li>Church is a word not unlike Wealth or Power, whose myriad meanings appear to grant huge agency in human minds, by obfuscating numerous concepts into one. "Church" means both "temple" and "religion" at the same time, while also meaning neither of those, and both other things and not other things. "Catholic Church" can mean a temple, congregation, priest, parish (congregation + priest), bishop (regional manager for priests), diocese (region covered by a bishop - or archdiocese is a large diocese whose bishop is called an archbishop), Vatican City, the College of Bishops, The Pope, and all of the above. Part of this is because religions were the original megacorporation, and in some legends (WH40k) remain the only megacorps.</li>
					<li>Cities in the USA are incorporated similar to businesses.</li>
					<li>Close your mouth when you chew on your words.</li>
					<li>Coindice (d2) should not have flat edges and should not be a flat cylinder. Ideal currency are extremely short cylinders, and thus have 3 sides. The coindice's sides should be triangular to prevent landing on the edge - giving it 4 sides, where the coin's center of gravity is outside the coin for 2 of them. The easiest way to do this is to sharpen a coin, but beware the weaponization of sharpened currency. This makes a d6 modulus 2 superior to a coin-shaped object as a d2.</li>
					<li>Comedy means it has a happy ending. (Life is a comedy, not a tragedy.)</li>
					<li>Commodity comorbidity</li>
					<li>Community is a portmanteau of commune and unity.</li>
					<li>Compare and contrast Teslaquila with Fallout 76 Tequila.</li>
					<li>Conservative and liberal extremists, and incels and some feminists - at the very extremes, are the same people: hateful of everyone and everything, because they hate themselves. So they take this out on the world around them, trying to "share the love" they feel, and burn something or everything down with their rage.</li>
					<li>Cops see blue-stripe flags as "thoughts and prayers".</li>
					<li>Corruption in government is like rust in iron. Political agency (aka power) corrupts, and political agency is magnetic to the corruptible (Frank Herbert), so political agency should goto those most resistant to corruption. Oxygen rusts, as oxygen is magnetic to rust-prone iron. Power is like oxygen but not every leader is like iron, taking bribes before its term even starts. Some are like cobalt, pitting 2 corruptive influences against each other so neither gets the upper hand over it.</li>
					<li>Critical Race Theory and Reparations - we can't repay harms conducted against a specific race, if races are a social construct. We could still repay specific lineages for the crimes perpetrated against their ancestry. But a type of reparations are already being paid, through increased use of social safety nets by lineages thus disadvantaged, in a way so socially equal that it sickens Both Sides.</li>
					<li>Cryptocurrencies all have massive roller-coaster-like inflations and deflations, which make them terrible as both daily use currency and as a store of wealth. They're only useful as a way to transfer wealth from funded gullible people to rich amoral people. </li>
					<li>Currencies are (almost) ideal gases and prices are basically temperatures, showing both the quantity and the velocity of money.</li>
					<li>Current things must end so new things can begin. Good things ending is the price we must pay for bad things also ending.</li>
					<li>Cynicism as knowing the price of everything and the cost of nothing. Post-cynicism as knowing the cost of everything and the price of nothing. Respecting things through knowing not just their market value, but also the human and robot labor involved in constructing one, the difficulty involved in going without or getting a quick replacement, and the complications of logistics.</li>
<h4>D</h4>
					<li>Datadog are a data logging company who don't even write their own logging utilities. They use(d) Log4J and had to have all their agents patched after the hack.</li>
					<li>Democracies tend to have better documentation than other political systems because they aren't 1984'ing their population.</li>
					<li>Deserts (Plains) are holy because they are purified by the sun. Swamps (wetlands) are holy because they're purified by the rain.  Where is purified by both rain and sun - Seattle in summer?</li>
					<li>Deserts are deserted. Often arid and dusty, but most are not sandy.</li>
					<li>Desire is suffering. (Buddhism) Advertising induces desire to generate economic activity, and in an extreme sense could be construed as a form of paid torture. - 2015.</li>
					<li>Didn't your momma ever tell you that life isn't fair?</li>
					<li>Different destinations shift goalposts.</li>
					<li>Discovery, as a legal process, seems to take forever because it's both recursive and iterative, foreaching through every item and expanding every subproperty. It's a branching search method to find items secured in obscurity. This is due to the adversarial nature of auditing, where the business's success is based on limiting external information, and the auditor's success is based on clawing back these limits to expose as much as possible. </li>
					<li>"Don't hit women" is sexist. Don't hit people - unless in self defense or emergency defense of another, and with just enough overwhelming force that the other person does not want to return a hit and the fight is over.</li>
					<li>Digression is rambling, and saying "but I digress" is merely acknowledgment.</li>
					<li>Disconfabulate the constabulate. (Don't talk to cops, whose job it is to arrest people and beyond.)</li>
					<li>Distance from Earth's center to the crust is a little longer than NY-Hamburg. Then from crust to space is from Hamburg to Warsawa.</li>
					<li>Do things that don't scale, like moving fast and breaking things.</li>
					<li>Do you rhyme at least some of the time? You might be a poet and not even know it. Click here to take our free test.</li>
					<li>Dodge's existential issue is they only want to make muscle cars. Dodge Ram is a muscle car with an open-air trunk.</li>
					<li>Diversity isn't about getting 2 of every Pokemon on your creative Ark - but instead about not limiting yourself from hiring the best because of their arbitrary attributes. Somehow anti-racism turned out to be racism all along, and likewise anti-sexism turned out to be sexism wearing a dress instead of a suit.</li>
					<li>Dot Product and Cross Product are two ways of combining vectors. Multiplication is a generalization of both of them, thus both the Dot (*) and Cross (x) can be used to multiply. And this becomes the "who(m)" of basic math, a place for intellectual authoritarians to belittle the average person.</li>
					<li>Dodos aren't a running joke; they're a flightless joke.</li>
					<li>Dog going inside-outside-inside-outside is taking a binary random walk between a pair of equally-optimal states. Inside is too warm and boring. Outside is too cold and boring.</li>
					<li>Doing anything is merely a matter of having the correct verbal, material, and somatic components at the correct location and time. (The somatic components may take extensive training to master, and this should always be taken into consideration - take care when identifying something as trivial.)</li>
					<li>Don't talk *about* people, talk *TO* people. - 2015. Don't talk to people - talk to what people have done. - 2020</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKkUtrL6B18">Dopamine activates neurons</a>, while serotonin deactivates neurons. Hence anxiety is too much dopamine or too little serotonin. Dopamine down-regulates serotonin, so the more pleasure you seek, the less happy you become. This chemical-backed intention becomes the delta between our happiness and our pleasure. The Kierkegaardian Finite would be serotonin, and dopamine would compliment this as the Kierkegaardian Infinite - don't get stuck chasing either pleasure or happiness, but seek to go back and forth between them. (Take weekends and vacations off. What lay in the middle of the spectrum between pleasure and happiness?)</li>
					<li>Double Chiller - like a Double Boiler (use a hot water bath to heat a pot of food) - but using a cold tap water bath instead, to cool instead of heat. Ice baths can be used but are usually more work than just dumping off the now-hot water and refilling the bath with cold tap water. If ice is required, you might be overextending this technique beyond what the food can handle.</li>
					<li>Dr Who got back to the future the old fashioned way - <a href="/memes/longwayround.png">the long way around</a>.</li>
					<li>Dunbar's Number cognitively drives us to "uncare" about most people we see in life, because there are so many of us, and we can travel so far so fast. Racism is a "lazy algorithm" for doing this, based solely on surface features. Greater emotional intelligence tells us that we ourselves aren't that way - and greater mechanical intelligence informs that this "lazy algorithm" doesn't provide very repeatable results. Both drive a more complex algorithm based more on responses than appearances. Since this algorithm is therefore a function of either intelligence, racism becomes a lack of several types of intelligence, which explains why there are racists of every color, gender, nation, and creed, just as there are geniuses of every color, gender, nation, and creed in every scientific field. Both are intelligence-based phenomena, and the same bell-curve of intelligence occurs in all human societies at the same rate, regardless of demographic factors.</li>
<h4>E</h4>
					<li>Eagles (band) are maligned because 1. they're croners and 2. they're almost impossible to license, because each artist in the band was his own company, so each song is copywritten 3-4 times, and requires 3-4 times as much paperwork to license. (Compared to KISS, which is like 1 license owner and 3 employees. Maybe they recently streamlined this? Please let the site owner know.) This keeps their music out of, like, bar scenes in movies. So their haters still hate them, but they don't really pick up new fans, and their old fans move on. Overlicensing sorta killed their brand.</li>
					<li>Earthbound: A cosmic force (gravity) binds us to Earth, and we must pay an enormous (energy) debt to this cosmic force to buy our liberation. "We are altering your Earthbound property. You are no longer Earthbound."</li>
					<li>Edges and corners are disproportionately impacted by probability. This is why river rocks are rounded. (Is this also true of graphs?)</li>
					<li>Efficiency and laziness are two sides of the same coin. Great efficiency enables great laziness - if you get all your work done early then you can take a break until everyone else catches up. Or be Napoleon/Caesar and do the extra credit too, getting that A++.</li>
					<li>Either free markets are true and at least *some* consumption within them can be ethical - the consumption of my services is ethical - or free markets are false and we're all slaves to board room decisions.</li>
					<li>Electronics makes air conditioning mandatory, or condensation can cause short-circuits. The humans working with the electronics benefit from the A/C like an office plant benefits from the light that workers need to see.</li>
					<li>Emotions prevent most people from acting rationally toward or against groups intersecting their prejudices.</li>
					<li>"Enchanted" is a DM's "get out of reality free" card.</li>
					<li>ESG sucks because it doesn't make money. ESG that makes money - that's just good business, not ESG.</li>
					<li>Enjoy it while you can.</li>
					<li>Ensalottery - is the salad any good?</li>
					<li>Everyone on the Internet has an agenda. And if you don't, one will be assigned to you. - 2020</li>
					<li>Everything is either a blocker you use to prevent yourself from doing something you don't want to do, or it's yet another achievement you earn on the quest path. If you want it bad enough, you'll find a way, or (uninstall) of old age while you're looking for one. - 2014. (Like Einstein did with the Theory of Everything.)</li>
					<li>Evil - self-centered, uncaring of others, narcissistic.</li>
					<li>Expertise is non-transferable between fields or people. (Dunning-Kreuger)</li>
					<li>Extremely loud and incredibly slow (Why is your car?)</li>
<h4>F</h4>
					<li>F Murray Abraham, F Scott Fitzgerald, and "eff" this (person/place/thing).</li>
					<li>Fahrenheit and Celsius are 2 buildings next to each other. Celsius is on a hill that's as tall as Fahrenheit's 32nd floor. There are 9 floors in Fahrenheit for every 5 floors in Celsius, and they have a weird shared basement that goes down forever. You're on the 20th floor of Celsius, looking at Fahrenheit. Which floor are you directly across from? (The 68th.)</li>
					<li>fam=ily</li>
					<li>Family means Forever when you're a suburban mother who's trying to get your kids to eat their vegetables instead of yell at each other. Once you're an adult, like how age is just a number, family is just a name.</li>
					<li>Fast &amp; Furious is safe, like one of those Telltale games where you can't (uninstall). It's the ultimate dissection of understanding the villain. (Or maybe Batman is?)</li>
					<li>Fed-Ups - The Package Handlers.</li>
					<li>Feminism has 2 versions, feminism-as-equality vs feminism-as-superiority. The second group wants to put all men into dresses, until they realize that a lot of us would enjoy it, in one way or another. And that we look better in a skirt and heels than them, since the average man exercises frequently and the average second group member does not.</li>
					<li>Ferrero could make UAP-themed Tic Tacs. They could have a little green or gray candy body inside the Tic Tac.</li>
					<li>Finding yourself in 2 steps: 1 lose yourself, and 2 move about randomly, learning your way back to what you know.</li>
					<li>Fireworks are more effective than silencers at hiding gunshots. So are misfiring cars, but it's nontrivial to get a fuel injected car to misfire, and impossible for an electric.</li>
					<li>Flip the narrative to understand the characters. Flip the characters to understand the narrative.</li>
					<li>Foley folly</li>
					<li>Fomenting the foe-men. (Rabble rousers)</li>
					<li>Forcefully apply Dunning-Kreuger to keep intellectuals in their areas of expertise.</li>
					<li>Ford cars taste like a gross smoothie.</li>
					<li>Forests are chaotic nests of floral combat.</li>
					<li>Foundational elements - things you don't even think about.</li>
					<li>French word for for "thank you" Is the Spanish word for "sea" followed by English word.</li>
					<li>Friends aren't forever. Some friendships last just 5 minutes. </li>

					<li>Guns are a "nuclear solution" to minor disputes, and work as well as deterring minor border skirmishes with a full thermonuclear war. Having a gun precludes choosing lesser weaponry, partly because we're taught that the only way to use a gun is to shoot someone with it, and that this is always immediately fatal. Much of this is the marketing dichotomy of "get them before they get you", using the "unnamed them" to incept FUD. One of the Air Force's newest missiles doesn't explode at all - it can precision drop onto a single military target (like a foreign general leading a conflict against the USA) with minimum casualties. Likewise, we need to bring back large sticks.</li>

					<li>Humans in space would always need to be shielded from all solar UV radiation, as there's insufficient atmosphere to absorb the most harmful UV rays, and thus tanning in space is only a carcinogen and never safe.

					<li>"Make them pay for it" destabilizes nations while recruiting freedom fighters to free them from your economic tyranny. War reparations are one of the biggest causes of conflicts between nations (behind wanting more dimensional resources (land) to expand into), as it turns hearts and minds against you.

There's no escapism into these movies because they're about what we're all trying to escape from: modern day. No isekai because they aren't another world - they're this same world. Claiming that we have no right to escape from our first world problems belies the cliamant's lack of sympathy, in ignoring that most of us don't enjoy living in this political whirlpool all of the time, and once in a while need to put our heads into a space that isn't constantly spinning. - 2023</li>

					<li>Mass Hysteria is a sexist term that means "Mass Deluded Belongingness", where people will invent memories and create damage to their own clothing or health, in an attempt to "fit into" the "popular group". This was greatly exacerbated by the extreme cultural pressures to "fit into" the "popular group" that pervaded human settlements before the 1960s. The way to test for this need-based psychology is to separate the individuals and interview them - any discrepancies between their stories will become apparent, debunk any delusion (including any held by yourself), and help reveal reality.</li>

					<li>Members of one political party will intentionally hurt themselves during the other party's turn, so they can truthfully say that people got hurt during the other party's turn. Like if the Dodgers were hosting the Astros, and during the bottom of every inning, a bunch of Astros fans started a fight, every inning, until the 5th inning when security cleared out a huge chunk of the stands. And the Astros fans did this so they could talk about how unsafe it is when the Dodgers are at bat, because of all the fights in the stands - therefore the Dodgers shouldn't be allowed to bat anymore, and only the Astros should bat. Where's the political equivalent of unsportspersonlike conduct? Ethics lol. Where's the political equivalent of a fiduciary?</li>
					<li>Memories are like video game demos - instead of recording the state of every object at every second, or even every pixel on your screen, just record the inputs (of all players for a game) and replay these on the same hardware and software to get a playback. Game players could send these to other players with the same code and compatible hardware and they could also playback the gameplay - it was common on the lower-bandwidth Internet of the 1990s. A problem arises when a new version of the game comes out, with bug fixes and maybe other changes. Now that replay has slight problems - the fence is slightly taller, so the player can't jump over it, and doesn't make the amazing flag return. This means that team doesn't score a point, and turns a win into a tie - but that's not what happened in the original match. So too our human memories are recordings of inputs replayed onto our neurons - and so the constant reoptimizations in neural connections may cause vagueness in the playback of a human's memory.</li>

					<li>Meyers-Briggs reflects how the situation impacts you. We're all extroverts around people who energize us and introverts around people who drain us. INTJ (Introvert Intuition Thinking Judging) is projecting, or motion from inside going outward. ESFP (Extrovert Sensing Feeling Perceiving) is receiving, or motion from outside going inward. Neither one is better than the other, and what's better than either one is moving between them in a Kierkegaardian way. Receive so you know what to project, and project so you're empty and ready to receive. Time this correctly and it becomes a conversation, which is an analog data transmission protocol between neural networks.</li>
					<li>Microeconomics revealed itself to be an illusion in 2020, where some items went on sale despite being out of stock. Protip: you can't incentivize a marginal increase in the sales of a product when there is no stock of that product to sell. You could sell a future of that product, possibly on backorder, but that's a different financial product.</li>

NOS in cars is similar to turbo/super charging (or tank-charging using a separate air compressor and air tank) in injecting more compressed oxygen into the combustion chamber. Can you put NOS in a twin turbo or super/turbo hybrid system? Yes, but they do the same thing so why?

					<li>Nuclear energy can be converted into electrical energy through several routes. The most common is nuclear-steam tech, but steam has always had an explosion problem (why diesel-electric and jet-electric trains became common), and mixing water with the common zirconium shell causes even more explosions. (Zirconium is used because it's nearly transparent to neutrons.) Not to mention that these are designed as large as possible, necessitating a critical mass of material for normal operations. Other options, like betavoltaic, have an image problem in that they're nowhere near as glamorous as the giant cooling tower. (Cooling towers are shaped that way because technically they're using jet technology to increase airflow.) Thankfully micro-reactors are gaining popularity, as the public isn't nearly as afraid of neutrons (subatomic particles blocked by an inch of doped plastic) as we are of smog (the unbreathable smoke-fog death cloud).</li>

					<li>People are attracted to what they fear (because fear is a lack of information often supplemented by invented information, so this is a dopamine-validation loop), try to correct what they think is wrong, and fight against what they don't understand. Often fighting to correct, what they think is wrong about what they're attracted to, out of a lack of accurate information. Have the courage to academically study your fears, the inner peace to accept what you think is wrong in the world, and honesty about these with yourself and others. - 2022 (Fear is a partial model, wrong is having 2 models and wanting the other one, and not understand is having no (viable) model. So this is having 2 incomplete models, and wanting the other one because it has more desirable imagined statistics.)</li>

					<li>People are so jaded that it's harder and harder for artists to make us feel anything.</li>
					<li>People choose a narrative that will make them happy, and work to make it real: Use finances and large companies to facilitate the purchasing of material components and somatic training to construct the stage upon which they will live out a Shakespearian tragedy, with you in their front row. And once you see your life as a comedy, unlike their tragedy - you'll see them not as demons destroying your hard work, but angels building your empire for you, by giving you their dreams and buying them back from you.</li>
					<li>People commit illegal activities *despite* the activity being illegal, not *because* the activity is illegal. (People who commit crimes specifically to break the law either have a mental condition like kleptomania, or a grudge against a specific jurisdiction.) Why are they performing these activities? Because there are no jobs in the USA, so the only ways to make enough money to buy a house and have kids are either military service or illegal farming. Why is the farming illegal? So it doesn't compete with medical opium sales. Why are there no jobs? Because to ensure world peace, we exported all of our medium-paying laboring jobs to other nations, so they'd be on "our side" during the Cold War. Why were we fighting the Cold War? Because Stalin didn't like not getting war reparations out of all of Germany after WW2, and also just to be contrary to another world power with a different set of popular political philosophies. What caused WW2? Extensive WW1 reparations caused an intense surge in both nationalism and socialism within the new German nation, and these merged into the greatest moral evil of the modern era. Why were Germany paying WW1 reparations? Because they lost WW1 and their monarch Hohenzolleren disappeared. (Everybody lost WW1, in one way or another - nobody was a real winner in that war. A lot of authors and idealists lost their innocence.) Why were they fighting WW1? Because Europeans were hungry for a good war, as they hadn't had one in a while, and since there wasn't always an exchange rate set between 2 nations, there might be no mechanism other than post-war looting to get what another nation had. Why were Europeans hungry for a good war? Because before then, "war" meant melees with clubs and maybe swords, and glorious commanders on valiant steeds - not too different from modern amateur sportsball teams, especially with scrums. WW1 was the world's introduction to industrial combat. Why was house of Hohenzolleren the monarch? Because the house was formed after Grand Master Albert of the Teutonic Order converted to Lutheranism, to steal the Catholic Church's riches. Why was the Catholic Church so rich? They had become corrupt, and were selling "get out of Hell free" cards in exchange for enough money to buy, like, a horse - and aristocrats were buying these for each of their deceased relatives - partly out of moral duty, partly to "keep up with the Joneses".</li>

					<li>Qubits are analog, allowing sub-bit precision in binary systems. This could allow smaller neural networks, as instead of using a large binary number as an approximation for an analog state, the analog state can be approximated in the smallest binary numbers.

					<li>S3 (Simple Storage Service) wants to achieve "six nines" (99.9999% uptime aka unavailable for less than 31.53 seconds per year), and could achieve this if they were an independent company. But the DNS, console, networking, operational, business, and brand parts of AWS get in the way and steal 3 of their 9s (aka make them unavailable for more than 8.76 hours but less than 87.6 hours in a year). The risk here isn't data <i>loss</i>, but data <i>unavailability</i>, where your files are offline for several hours at a time. This calls for a solution closer to the BC end of the spectrum between BC (business continuity) to DR (disaster recovery), such as heavy use of caching at various layers (browser, CDN, server, upstream cache, et cetera) and asynchronous jobs that can be delayed for hours or days.</li>

And so they either build part of their life around this - maybe making it a major issue, or taking it on as a hobby. Or making the problem happen again, so they can be in a familiar situation. It's escapism into problem solving, instead of narratives, as both are places that put the individual back in control. (Also how psychotic people meet people, according to that one test.)</li>

					<li>Science Authoritarians, trying to prove a Great Man right. Like still trying to prove/disprove Newton or Einstein. Why not a great woman like Ada Lovelace or Marie Curie?</li>
					<li>Scientific and technological progress stalled in medieval Europe because the people in control of society (gatekeepers) couldn't tell the difference between science, magic, and alchemy. All kinds of charlatans would perform parlor tricks and slight of hand to entertain these monarchs. This turned the monarchs into the Bigger Dollar Sign. (When shopkeepers see you only as a walking dollar sign, and someone else as a bigger dollar sign.) Their only concern was outperforming their monarch peers, such as Russia with their vast eastern territories, or Dutch with their vast trade empire. STEM were often shady topics that could not be discussed in the light of day, and random fields would be banned for offending the local monarch. (This continued through WW2, with NSGermany's leadership denouncing quantum physics as inferior because some of the field's experts shared a genetic heritage.)</li>

(The other human's job in this situation is to help the first move from the Bargaining step to the Acceptance step, while being aware of the Anger step.)

					<li>So many good things were made in the late 1960s because the Boomers were in their 20s. Why were so many good things made in the 1860s? Because so many people were fleeing the disaster that was the CSA. (The CSA was a disaster partly because it started with massive land theft, taking entire States-worth of land from the USA. It kinda held hostage all of the humans who didn't want to (or couldn't) move nor join the CSA. Some of these humans were physically enslaved in an unprofitable and oppressive union of serfdom and incarceration. (Why pay humans to guard the humans working your land, when you could just pay the working humans directly? Guards cost more than farmers because of the riskier job, and you need about as many or maybe more.) The entire debacle was a sludge pit of immoral decisions, which is no foundation to build any government nor society.) What about the 2060s?</li>
					<li>Social influence falls off at an inverse square of degrees of separation. Influence = 1/Degrees+1. You have full influence (1/1) over yourself at the "zeroeth" degree, like 50% influence over 1st degree friends, 25% influence over 2nd degree friends of friends, 12.5% (1/4) over 3rd degree relations, 6.25% over 4th, 3.125% over 5th, 1.5625% (1/7) over 6th, and 0.78125% over 7th (when we reach that level of social complexity). - 2017</li>
					<li>Social Media, the "salons of our age, where Thought Leaders exchange Important Ideas", are Validation Casinos, where we pay in comments and payout in upvotes. (Imgur's tutorial literally instructs new users to find a specific downvoted post and downvote it again, as a rite of passage - this is also training the user to play "upvote/downvote", and continue downvoting things that already have downvotes without critical thinking about the post.)</li>
					<li>Socialism wasn't Chinese enough for China's CCP. They wanted "socialism with Chinese characteristics" aka fit with one-party rule, which wasn't Socialism but State Capitalism. Likewise, cooperative international space exploration isn't Chinese enough - they want State Capitalism In Space. (Has every implementation of communism been tied with one-party rule? Have there been any multi-party communist systems?)</li>

					<li>T-Rex had arms solely for male-male combat, because they would perform the male combat mating display by chest-bumping each other and flailing with their sharp claws against the other's chest, until one admitted defeat. (from YDAW? Also this sounds like Dino Sumo.) Hunting was entirely different: chasing prey jaws-first. (Is the mating display always so different from an interspecies hunting attack?

(What does that say for the Bible parallel - were Adam and Eve the ones who really lit Eden ablaze? Maybe Prometheus met them there? Or Lilith after she met Prometheus?) The Oracle's understanding of humanity ultimately led to her joining their side - indeed she's able to process the patterns from human input so well that she can calculate which of her inputs into a given human will produce a given output. She can operate humans the way humans operate a car, something that makes her unique among The Machines.</li>

Some dedicate themselves to The Climb, working to improve their self and status through education, employment, or other investments of time and their money.  While others look forward to going downhill because life gets easier for a little bit, while going downhill. Then they stop descending and life difficulty reasserts itself, but without the amenities. Having a cabin in the woods or a loft in the sky are both equal on The Mountain, in that both are the same: having a grand home.

Name a shop that works on that type of car. (Prepare these lies in advance.) Then say that your expensive house is being repaired, and drive past someone else's expensive house to show the repairs. Say that you're staying in a crummy apartment during the repairs, and use that excuse to bring them to your crummy apartment for the night.)</li>
					<li>The way to herd kittens is with tuna. - Unknown, 2007</li>
					<li>The whole point of keeping a change log - in theory - is so you could "replay" your data center from a known snapshot, like SQL transaction log or a commit history. Any change to any system should be recorded, so it can be performed again later - either to rebuild this system, build a future system, troubleshoot, et cetera. This breaks down when human laziness omits "small" changes from the reporting system. Or when the change management cadence is too long - at a previous employer, we would email specs to our cloud host, and they would manually build the system, often with too many NICs. Removing the excess NICs required a change approver's sign-off from the weekly meeting. So each configuration error added a week to the build time. Change management merges perfectly with configuration management at the intersection of infrastructure as code, where any change must be approved as part of the commit process. This merges development and change processes while removing the "small change" category - increasing your flexibility through the tighter feedback loop, increasing security through recording all changes, reducing costs &amp; complexity through reducing operations administration needs. This is the same mix of benefits as seen through cloud-native architecture, and these should pair nicely.</li>

					<li>Tragedy means it has a sad ending.</li>

					<li>Werewolf is past tense of Iswolf.</li>
					<li>What makes a computer tick? The computer's clock makes it tick. Kernels are the base-level programs that run on (micro)processors.

					<li>Woke Hollywood is like getting a cheese pizza and asking for pepperoni. SO they take it back and make an all-pepperoni pizza. Pepperoni crust, pepperoni sauce, pepperoni cheese.

Can't talk to these entertainment extremists like normal people - they intentionally misunderstand.</li>
					<li>Women and children = females and wee-males</li>
					<li>Words that are incredibly vague and convey a surface-level understanding and lack of deep knowledge - be more skeptical and discerning when reading these: Scientist. Power. Wealth. Truth(s). Lie(s).</li>

					<li>You wear what you eat. Literally, if you have bad table manners.</li>
