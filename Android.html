				<h1>Android by Fantasy Flight Games</h1>
				<h4>In <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android/">Android</a>, players take the role of a troubled detective, willing to do almost anything - undercut another detective, plant evidence to create a murder case they can solve, even creating a conspiracy out of circumstance and paranoia - to cover up and deal with the personal demons that haunt them.</h4>
			</div><br>
			<div class="textBubbleBG">
				<h1>The Game Round</h1>
				<h4>Android is played across 13 rounds, or Days, each consisting of Daytime and End of Day phases. The last 2 phases are the "Climax", and always come too soon.

			<h2>Daytime - Your turn</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
			<h4>Move around the game board - any location within your vehicle ruler. </h4>
			</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Beanstalk has to be traversed to get from Earth to Moon and back - can only enter from Starport Kaguya on Moon, and The Root on Earth, and spend 1 time to move through each location (5 total). </li>
					<li>Dropship Pass lets you travel anywhere on the board, even skipping the Beanstalk.</li>
					<li>Restricted Locations cost 3 time instead of 1, unless you have a warrant.</li>
					<li>Ritzy locations (diamond) let you draw 1 Light card & Seedy locations (triangle) let you draw 1 Dark card.</li>
					<li>5 kinds of location, important for moving leads and some Twilight cards, but they don't affect movement in general.</li>
				</ul>
				<li><h4>Investigate leads - either plant evidence, or a conspiracy puzzle piece. </h4></li>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Everyone's guilty of something, right? What's it matter if they get punished for the wrong crime, so long as they get punished.</strong></li>
					<li>3 kinds of leads - testimony, physical, and document. </li>
					<li>Detective has to be on a location with a lead. </li>
					<li>Lead is moved when it's investigated, except during The Climax. </li>
					<li>Player to the right rolls a d6 to see which district gets the lead, then moves it to another location of the same color - Religious (yellow), Civic (green), Residential (red), Business (blue), and Nightlife (purple) - that doesn't already have a lead. </li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Plant evidence</h4></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Player draws an Evidence Token, then plants it on any suspect.</li>
					<li>The Evidence Token must be planted on the matching area as the lead being investigated. (i.e. the Evidence Token from investigating a Physical lead must be planted on a Physical )</li>
					<li>Evidence Tokens have a value from 5 to -4 - the suspect with the highest total is found guilty of the murder.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Players could strategically reduce one suspect's guilt, if the player would score more points with a different guilty suspect.</li>
						<li>Different kinds of evidence impact different suspects differently - the lowest-value Strong evidence and highest value Weak evidence, for each suspect, are removed when scoring.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Surprise Witness Tokens are -5.</li>
					<li>Perjury Tokens change Surprise Witness and Alibi tokens from -5 to +5.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Build a Conspiracy puzzle</h4></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Baggage (most), Favor (middle), Shift (least) </li>
					<li>Plant Information </li>
					<ul>
						<li>Roll a d4 (reroll 1) to find what type of piece you get.</li>
						<li>Use the benefit of the type of piece </li>
					</ul>
					<li>Light/dark-shift someone</li>
					<li>Get a normal favor</li>
					<li>Place baggage</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Place the piece on the board.</li>
						<li>Get the benefit of any bonus on the front of the piece. </li>
					</ul>
					<li>FIngerprint - Add 1 physical evidence to the suspect of your choice.</li>
					<li>Skull - Add 1 strong evidence to the suspect of your choice.</li>
					<li>Bonus puzzle piece - go again.</li>
					<li>Jinteki / Haas link - add bonus Victory Points.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Draw and play Twilight cards - Draw or discard any light or dark card, or play any light card.</h4></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Players may pay 1 time to discard any light or dark card in their hand, or draw their own light or any other player's dark card.</li>
					<li>Cards are usually only played on a player's turn - light cards played by them, and dark cards played by other players against them.</li>
					<li>Light cards cost 1 Time and 1 or more dark shifts to play.</li>
					<li>Dark cards cost 0 Time and 1 or more dark shifts to play, since they aren't played during your turn.</li>
					<li>Any other card may be discarded to subtract 1 light or dark shift from the cost, down to 0.</li>
					<li>Cards matching the plot color let you add or subtract 1 light or dark shift from the cost. </li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Get a jump on the case.</h4></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Claim "First Player"ship on the next turn.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Use Location Abilities</h4></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Major Locations allow Favors to be exchanged for other items.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Use Event Abilities</h4></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Some General and Specific events have abilites that may be used.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			</div><br>
			<div class="textBubbleBG">
			<h2>Daytime - Other players' turns:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Play dark cards against other players</h4></li>
				<ul>
					<li>One other player may play a Dark card against your detective during your turn.</li>
					<li>Some Dark cards can only be played when their detective enters a location -- any Dark card effects happen after the Ritzy/Seedy free card draw.</li>
					<li>Fight cards require the detective to light-shift or dark-shift.</li>
					<li>Only 1 player may play a Dark card per turn - so the First Player gets an opportuninty to play a Dark card first. The First Player can pass this opportuninty to the player on their right, who also gets to play a Dark card or pass to their right. If it's the First Player's turn, this starts with the player to their right instead.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			</div><br>
			<div class="textBubbleBG">

					<li>Specific events rearrange all the leads. </li>
					<ul>

					<li>Surprise Witness are also placed on a Suspect, to give them -5 Guilt. </li>
