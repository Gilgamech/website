Living on Mars:
- Food - Mushrooms
- Material - PVC frees up oxygen from perchlorate and uses the chlorine. Also bring sodium to create salt.


History:
- Local governments control local banks.
- Governments issue debt bonds to raise money.
- Banks use money raised from citizens (bank account deposits?) to buy local government's debt.
- Governments uses basically Eminent Domain to buy farmland from farmers. Structures increase how much the government pays the farmer, so farmers put up "nail houses" which are unsafe multi-floor structures. (How do the farmers own the land? Or did they get the land from the local government with some type of long-term lease, for maybe 50, 70, or 99 years?)
- Governments "sell" (aka long-term lease) land through bids to property developers.
- Property developers borrow from local banks, who approve the loans because they're controlled by the government and can't not loan to the winning bidder.
- Property developers use their size and government-backed funding to get loans from other financial institutions, including international banks.
- Property developers "sell" (aka long-term lease) condominiums to citizens. These assets are called "houses" despite not being a separate structure and involving no land rights beyond the structure.
- Property developers use funds to buy more land from governments, becoming Ponzi Schemes.
- Property prices keep going up so citizens feel pressured to "buy" now before prices raise even more. Citizens buy condominiums that aren't finished, or sometimes aren't even built yet. (There's supposed to be a limit of one per citizen, but many citizens find loopholes to buy more.) 

- Property developers collapse. Evergrande is the largest, has $300 billion in debt - almost as much as is boycotted in protests. 
- Property developers employ 250 million Chinese workers, or close to 1/3 of the 784 million Chinese labor force.
- Chinese home sales and construction account for 25% of China's GDP.

- Property prices peaked, so citizens stop buying, and wait to see if prices will go down more.
- If property doesn't sell, property developers can't repay government. This turns the government debt into a Collateralized Debt Obligation.
- Reductions in property value reduce the amount of money that banks will lend to property developers, preventing them from getting the funds needed to complete (or start) their existing projects. 
- 3 Red Lines regulation prevents property developers from borrowing more if they had already borrowed too much, or had too many liabilities. 
- Zero-Covid policies shut down major cities for months, closing many businesses and forcing most people to spend through their personal savings. So they don't really have the money to be making payments for a place they're not living in and whose value is going down. 
- Rich citizens take $48 billion in assets as they leave. 
- Citizens form 300+ protests in 90+ cities, because the condominiums aren't getting completed, and they aren't paying. 10% of properties sold last year weren't finished. $297 billion of loans are boycotted, 4.2% of the $7 trillion Chinese mortgate market. 
- Undercover police and travel bans set up to prevent protests.
- Some banks are unable to cover citizen withdrawals. This collides with a separate scam where bank employees lied to citizens, and sold them an investment disguised as a checking or savings account.
- Local banks start failing. (the Lehman Brothers moment)
- Governments tell citizens to "buy" (aka lease for 70-ish years) condominiums. The limit of one per citizen is removed, and people are told to buy one more regardless of how many the already own.
- Central government starts making "eat the rich" moves under banner of "common prosperity", stealing assets from affluent citizens to repay debts taken out by other citizens. 
- Central government proposing banks write-off $4.3 billion in loans.

- Central government demolishes 3 billion sq meters of ghost towns to keep housing prices high - enough to house 75 million people if they were finished. (Were the mortgage holders compensated in some way?)
- 33% contraction predicted in the market.
