			<p>One aspect of traditional dieting is caloric restriction, which keeps a person in a low blood sugar state, which slightly impairs judgment. The basic concept of "calories in minus calories out" isn't incorrect in theory, but there are upper and lower limits to human intake and output. An average human has a resting metabolic rate of around 1500 calories:</p>
			<p>Calorie stream vs large meals</p>
			<p>Shouting loudly for calories vs shouting for many calories</p>

UFO groups are mired in moral and legal issues to the point that there are *only* toxic intersections. Further, many (incluidng Elizondo) badmouth the US State Dept, which is a sign that they were taught to get attention through negative means, a toxic attribute. Lastly, it's all monetized through merch, book deals, and interviews - without even reliable tours of UFO hotspots, an outdoorsy person gets more bang for their buck from a river fishing ride or astronomy trip.

How many solar panels to power X:
- Container ship
- USA's steel industry
- SpaceX Boca Chica launch facilities (Why is "the king of rooftop solar power" burning methane for electricity? Are there too few houses in Boca Chica?)
			
			Living on Mars:
			Food - Mushrooms
			Material - PVC frees up oxygen from percholrates and uses the chlorine. Also bring sodium to create salt.

Synergy: 
1. Take a number of related data points.
2. Put them in the same terms.
3. Set them equal to each other, and compute the results.

- 21st century weaponry
- quadcopter-dropped mortars - you're watching the hud and video on a screen, like a videogame. As problematic as early sci-fi may be, this was the plot of Ender's Game. 
- Electric motorcycles for snipers, to better move silently around enemy forces.
- Hopefully we'll see an increase in interest in these sports in the future. (Water-balloon dropping drones, to attack a college campus?)


- Food security 
- Peak Oil turns into Peak Effective Oil. There will still be huge amount s of oil in the ground long after renewables have replaced petroleum systems.  The goal of renewables is not global warming reduction but energy sovereignety. 
- Too much of the world is interconnected in fuel, which is a known issue fof geopolitical conllict. 
- 21st century interconnectedness led to sanctions, and also boycotts. 
- Russian propagamanda prevalent on news - it's like the last 4 years in the USA if there were no Democratic Party. Millions of Russians, mostly liberal, have left Russia recently. And Russia generally disperses liberals deep into Siberia, to be surrounded by conservatives, which has a chilling effect on liberal voices. 

Ukranian Hunger Games
- As Putin's War continues to stagnate around Ukraine's periphery, Ukranians are outputting a large amount of photos and videos into social media - both of their destroyed homes, and of the destroyed weapons of the Russian invaders. This is much like sending messages to your Patrons in Hunger Games, and receiving their beneficence.

				<p>Like many industries, IT industries require continual education.

				<h2 id="05312022"><a href="#05312022">05/31/2022</a> - 3d spooler business calculator.</h2>
				<p>A sequel to the <a href="https://www.gilgamech.com/blog.html#05142022">May 14th post</a>. </p>
				<p><a href="https://www.filabot.com/collections/filabot-core/products/full-recycling-setup">This device</a> costs $15k and  produces a one kg spool of filament in a little over an hour, which could either be shipped to customers by this business, or used in a complementary 3d printing business. (Need to check the cost of 3d printer spools, and possibly consider some kind of empty spool buyback program.) The Reclaimer takes post-consumer plastic as an input, meaning we could grind up soda bottles and turn them into filament to sell.</p>

				<h3>Self employment as a spool jockey</h3>
					<p>Minutes per spool: <input id="minPerSpool" class="roundInput validInput" type="number" oninput='runAllOfThese2()' value="66"></p>
					<p>Spools per hour per machine: <span id="spoolsPerHourPerMachine">0.85</span></p>

					<p>Working days per month: <input id="workingDaysPerMonth" class="roundInput validInput" type="number" oninput='runAllOfThese2()' value="21"></p>
					<p>Spools per month per machine: <span id="spoolsPerMonthPerMachine">126</span></p>

				<h3>Spooler inventory</h3>
					<p>Number of old machines: <input id="nOldMachines" class="roundInput validInput" type="number" oninput='runAllOfThese2()' value="0"></p>
					<p>Number of new machines: <input id="nNewMachines" class="roundInput validInput" type="number" oninput='runAllOfThese2()' value="1"></p>

				<h3>Plastic cost</h3>
					<p>Price per kg: $<input id="pricePerKg" class="roundInput validInput" type="number" oninput='runAllOfThese2()
					' value="1"></p>

				<h3>Fixed Costs</h3>
					<p>Total Machine cost: $<span id="totalMachineCost">15000</span></p>
					<p>Space cost per year: $<span id="spaceCostPerYear">31025</span></p>
					<p>Spools per year: <span id="spoolsPerYear">1512</span></p>
					
				<h3>Variable Costs (amortized across 1 year of spools)</h3>
					<p>Machine cost per spool: $<span id="machineCostPerSpool">9.92</span></p>
					<p>Space cost per spool: $<span id="spaceCostPerSpool">20.52</span></p>
					<p>Plastic cost per spool: $<span id="filamentCostPerSpool">1</span></p>
					<p>Cost per spool: $<span id="costPerSpool">31.44</span></p>
				
				<p>Because this outputs fewer spools than 3d prints in the 3d printer example before, the price of space is an even bigger input into the spool cost than it was into the 3d print cost. And so more than 4 machines in the same space quickly drops the price per spool down to market rates of around $20-25. This puts repayment rate foreach machine at around 600-750 1kg spools. To repay within 1 year, that's selling 1.6-2.1 per calendar day, or 2.3-3.0 per working day per machine. How many Google and Facebook ads would a business owner have to sell in order to move that much filament?</p>

				<h2 id="05172022"><a href="#05172022">05/17/2022</a> - Drifters drift but coasters don't coast.</h2>
				<p>Made a coaster.</p>
				<img src="https://www.gilgamech.com/images/BigGCoaster.jpg" />
				<p>The code was pretty simple, thanks to <a href="https://www.gilgamech.com/3dp/gilgahedron.txt">Gilgahedron</a>. Gilgahedron "simplifies" makng  shapes by combining size, transposition, and rotation into a single line. To use it, you'll have to rename from .txt to .SCAD after downloading, then put it in either where you save your SCAD files, or in OpenSCAD's library folder.</p>
				<p>Like the <a href="https://www.gilgamech.com/2022/April.html#04172022">Business Cart</a> and some other creations, this is a type of marketing demonstration. The "I will be back" is to honor the longstanding tradition of putting your coaster on your drink, to tell the bartender that you're planning to come back and finish it in a few minutes. As a type of automation, this message is hidden when the coaster is in under-drink mode. Anyway, here's the code for this coaster:</p>
				<div id="code31c" class="codeWrapper">
include  &lt;Gilgahedron.scad&gt;<br />
size=5;<br />
difference(){<br /><ul>
    icon_extrude("BigG.dxf",2.1,2.1,5,-.5,-.65);<br />
    gCylinder(10,33,33,0,0,5);<br />
    gText("Gilgamech",size,size,55,-18,20,-4);<br />
    gText("I will",size,size,55,-32,-2,-4);<br />
    gText("be back",size,size,55,8,-2,-4);<br />
    gText("Technologies",size,size,55,-21,-24,-4);<br />
</ul>}<br />
				</div>
				<p>The first 2 lines include Gilgahedron and set the text size to 5 mm. The 3rd and 4th line sets the extruded BigG icon as the main shape, and subtracts the other shapes from it. Gilgahedron shapes start with a data variable, if any, then have size in x, y, z, followed by location transposition in x, y, z, and finally rotation degrees in x, y, and z order.  So the icon is 2.1x larger than its initial size (about 84 mm), 5x taller (about 9.5 mm), and adjusted about 1/2 mm in the x and y directions, to correct an accidental offset.</p>
				<p>The 5th line creates a cylinder which is 10 mm tall and 33 mm radius at both top and bottom. It's shifted 5 mm down, so it intersects with the gear, deleting an inset to keep the cup. 33 mm is used to be just larger than a 64 mm diameter cup.</p>
				<p>LInes 6-9 are the text entries, sized up to 5 mm in width and height, and 55 mm tall - since these are just being subtracted from the gear, the height isn't very important, as long as its taller than the gear. In these, you can see the data variable being populated first with the text value, followed by the 'size' variable for x and y size &amp; 55 for the z dimension. Then these are each manually fit around the gear. Extending this part could include looping over the text string and rotating each character by 360 divided by the letter's location in the string .</p>

				<h2 id="05142022"><a href="#05142022">05/14/2022</a> - 3d printer business calculator.</h2>
				<p>3d printers and their filament are very cheap, compared to the value of the product they can print. (Not sure about the resin for resin printers). This should give some idea for the price inputs for starting a 3d printing business. It leaves off sale price, profit, and revenue, which are another key part of the startup equation.</p>

					<p>Cost per print: $<span id="costPerPrint">12.42</span></p>
				
				<p>By far, the biggest input is the cost of space, and if that space cost can be divided across several machines, it brings the price back down. Of course there are additional considerations, such as finishing, shipping, maintenance, and business operations such as accounting, HR, stock maintenance, security, etc.</p>
