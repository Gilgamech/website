Epstein/Maxwell unravels
Divorces: Gates, Bezos, Musk
Trump records and Jan6
- GOP ties (Congress and Senate members, missing/destroyed calls and notes)
- Fox News ties (Carlson, Hannity)
- Financialj ties (NY AG & Mazars) and 10 years of financial documents restatements.
Elon Musk
- Solarcity merger lawsuits
- Solarcity price hike lawsuits
- Gigafactory scandals
- SpaceX FAA environmental impact
- SpaceX departures "threaten to bankrupt company" since the Falcon is now unviable.
- Tesla cars called unreliable by Consumer Reports (They're as independent of Musk as they can be.)
- Tesla racism lawsuit
- Each company's loans use the other company's stocks as collateral, so the whole empire collapses if any stock price drops too far.
Joe Rogan
- 139 episodes pulled from Spotify for racist comments
Crypto
- Finally losing steam as it runs out of idiots

			<p>One aspect of traditional dieting is caloric restriction, which keeps a person in a low blood sugar state, which slightly impairs judgment. The basic concept of "calories in minus calories out" isn't incorrect in theory, but there are upper and lower limits to human intake and output. An average human has a resting metabolic rate of around 1500 calories:</p>
			<p>Calorie stream vs large meals</p>
			<p>Shouting loudly for calories vs shouting for many calories</p>

UFO groups are mired in moral and legal issues to the point that there are *only* toxic intersections. Further, many (incluidng Elizondo) badmouth the US State Dept, which is a sign that they were taught to get attention through negative means, a toxic attribute. Lastly, it's all monetized through merch, book deals, and interviews - without even reliable tours of UFO hotspots, an outdoorsy person gets more bang for their buck from a river fishing ride or astronomy trip.

How many solar panels to power X:
- Container ship
- USA's steel industry
- SpaceX Boca Chica launch facilities (Why is "the king of rooftop solar power" burning methane for electricity? Are there too few houses in Boca Chica?)
			
			Living on Mars:
			Food - Mushrooms
			Material - PVC frees up oxygen from percholrates and uses the chlorine. Also bring sodium to create salt.

Synergy: 
1. Take a number of related data points.
2. Put them in the same terms.
3. Set them equal to each other, and compute the results.

Reverse Seniority - where instead of your accomplishments stacking up, your errors stack up until you've made so many mistakes that nobody trusts you. 


Ukranian Hunger Games
- As Putin's War continues to stagnate around Ukraine's periphery, Ukranians are outputting a large amount of photos and videos into social media - both of their destroyed homes, and of the destroyed weapons of the Russian invaders. This is much like sending messages to your Patrons in Hunger Games, and receiving their beneficence. 


Imgur users hate the USA, with a passion. Anything good about the country gets turned bad, coupled with a weird form of conservatistic extreme liberalism only found on this site. Like it's overrun with trans soccer moms.

				<h2 id="04172022"><a href="#04172022">04/17/2022</a> - 3d printed business cards.</h2>
				<p>The goal is to 3d print 1mm thick business cards, which can be made into a toy. While this trial run wasn't a complete success, it's close enough that further development is inspired. The axle fittings in the wheels were too small, and so were the axle gaps in the body. And the fold hinges joining the body to the sides is too stiff, so it breaks instead of folding well. But these problems can be overcome. </p>

				<h2 id="04062022"><a href="#04062022">04/06/2022</a> - Zipper Clips.</h2>
				<p>A downside to my <a href="https://www.gilgamech.com/2021/December.html#12072021">Game Charger laptop bag</a> is that the zipper handles make a loud jingle when it's on my back. So I've made Big G chips, with a slot in the center just smaller than the zipper handle. They fit very snug, and make a quieter plastic jingle instead.</p>

				<h2 id="04042022"><a href="#04042022">04/04/2022</a> - CAD a little, skin a little, animate a little, render a little, print a little.</h2>
				<p>Work progresses on the door clamp idea. I'm basically moving into it, having to outfit it with every object I would have. So today I made a dishwasher, fridge, and tub, with surround. It feels like each thing I make reminds me to make like 10 more, but I'm building a huge shape and skin cache for future projects. Here's a photo of an intermediate render alongside my coin-sized Big G gear:</p>

				<h2 id="04022022"><a href="#04022022">04/02/2022</a> - Got a 3d printer.</h2>
				<p>Printed out the logo, and a door clamp. The cat was a demo shape that came with the printer. - it's a hollow shell, with another hollow shell in the middle, and honeycombing between. So that's another thing to learn how to do.</p>
