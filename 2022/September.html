<script>
addElement("0921Bubble","Burning natural gas is generally environmentally beneficial, as it converts 3 high absorbers of heat into 2 moderate absorbers of heat and 1 high absorber.","","p")
addElement("0921Bubble","- The process is CH4 + 2 O2 => CO2 + 2 H2O","","p")
addElement("0921Bubble","This process is not easily reversible; methane cracking involves generating hydrogen through electrolysis or other means, then pressure-cooking it with carbon dioxide. Or put a cowpie into a grass-filled mud puddle.","","p")
addElement("0921Bubble","To reference my blog post from last October, carbon's 4 'hands' allow each to hold the sole hand of a hydrogen atom. And the two dioxygen molecules are made from 2 oxygen atoms, tightly holding one pair of 'hands', but the other pair only loosely held together. Ignition gives enough energy to loosen a few 'hands', and at the end of the process: the two oxygen atoms from one of the dioxygen molecules have wrapped themselves around the carbon molecule, and the hydrogen atoms have dispersed themselves across the 4 open 'hands' of another oxygen molecule.","p")
addElement("0921Bubble","Methane has an atmospheric lifetime of 12 years - after this, what does it break down into? I'm guessing UV sunlight ionizes the molecule into water and CO2, the same products as combustion would create. Combustion creates these because they're the lowest-energy state of the system of atoms. But instead of this energy being used by humans, it's lost into the atmosphere.","","p")
addElement("0921Bubble","To put another way, carbon and hydrogen in the configuration named 'methane' represents a certain amount of energy, like a compressed spring, which will break apart and be released as heat at some point in the next 12 years. This energy can either be captured by humans, where at least some of it will be converted into rotational or electrical energy. Or it can be released into the atmosphere completely as heat.","","p")
addElement("0921Bubble","Considering whole mols of matter instead of individual chemicals allows easy comparing of energy absorption. In Joules of energy per mol:","","p")
addElement("0921Bubble","- Before: CH4 + 2 O2 = (35.69 + (2 * 29.38))/3 = 31.48 J/mol for every 1 degree increase.","","p")
addElement("0921Bubble","- After: CO2 + 2 H2O = (36.94 + (2 * 75.327))/3 = 62.53 J/mol for every 1 degree increase.","","p")
addElement("0921Bubble","So after burning methane, the products need twice as much energy to become the same temperature. Boltzmann's Constant tells us that the temperature of a gas is directly related to the average speed of its constituent molecules, and so this means it takes about twice as much energy to accelerate a water molecule to a given speed than a methane or dioxygen molecule. Much of this is due to water being a polar molecule, and thus being attracted to like molecules, instead of most gases which repel their like molecules.","","p")
addElement("0921Bubble","Burning methane for energy not only gives us a useful energy source, but also reduces how fast the atmosphere will heat up, and removes another heat source. This should be kept to well-maintained and regularly-audited industrial facilities, to prevent accidental weaponization through poor maintenance and lack of awareness of problems. Nobody wants their road to explode, which occasionally keeps happening in Seattle.","","p")
