Cloud providers work very hard to meet regulatory and security requirements needed to pass SOC and other audits, which are required by the SEC and other regulatory agencies for publicly-traded companies. Instead, this is a dystopian cyberpunk nightmare where regulations are a memory and no cloud provider can be trusted. On the surface, this means expecting your storage to actively copy your data, expecting your network to inject malware, and expecting your compute source to modify or add commands.","","p")
addElement("1022Bubble","It's cheaper and easier to not need to trust. Trust has 2 levels: that it works at all, and that it works correctly. The service has to be somewhere on a spectrum from incompetent to evil, assuming this is a profit-seeking situation. Further implications will reveal themselves as we dig deeper. On the way will be intersections with serverless website hosting, left shifting, and more. Grab your bit bucket and let's get started.","","p")

addElement("1022Bubble","You can (not) trust your storage host.","","h2")
addElement("1022Bubble","First, encrypt and hash all data, to prevent host-based surveilance and tampering. Compute logic should be stored within a hardened container such as Bottlerocket at a minimum, and preferrably within a hardened VM. Lambda-style server or edge scripts should not be used in a hostile environment, as there's no protection from modification or injection. Here is presented a tradeoff between security and cost, convenience, & complexity.","","p")

Again, security is placed against the trifecta of cost, convenience and complexity. Combining this with the at-rest encryption from the storage section may create an even more difficult barrier to surveil or inject through.","","p")
addElement("1022Bubble","Incoming connections must be restricted by address and port at all points - internet to cloud, cloud to OS, OS to application. Encrypting data before storing in databases et cetera is preferred, with info like usernames, street addresses, credit cards being randomish strings within the data structure, and only decrypted on the client's device. Databases should be password-protected and tables should be restricted to specific accounts. If possible, the database files should be encrypted at rest as well. Client updates would be encrypted before being transmitted and stored.","","p")
addElement("1022Bubble","Authentication mechanisms should rotate bearer tokens more frequently - on every request if possible. Use an algorithm for the client to transform the bearer token for return, to prevent direct sniffing reuse.","","p")

addElement("1022Bubble","You can (not) trust your compute source.","","h2")
addElement("1022Bubble","Compute isn't always necessary - you'll always have some flat files. And compute doesn't have to happen on the hostile host - it can happen on the client's device. You don't worry about the client's device being hostile - that's the user's problem. You don't need to trust anonymous client GETs, obviating this whole section. And this is the intersection with serverless hosting.","","p")
addElement("1022Bubble","When compute IS necessary, we return to the choice of security vs the trifecta. Compute logic is more secure when contained within a hardened container such as Bottlerocket, and even moreso within a hardened VM. Ultimate compute security would be your own OS on your own bare metal, which is the trifecta at extreme: the most expensive, most complicated, and least convenient.","","p")

Extending this to technology, each site is a disgrace deserving of being hacked. This can only be prepared for and mitigated effectively from the beginning, in the design and architecture of the site. Here is the intersection with Shift Left, embodied across the 3 layers above. By receiving the blessings of encryption, verification, and hardened compute, a website can remain untained from creation through delivery.","","p")

So assuming these are the old Dell or HP industry workhorse 2U rackmount server, this would all fit nicely into 1/2 rack. Ongoing Operations lists racks as still between $1000-$1500 per month.","","p")
addElement("1007Bubble","At a previous employer, back in 2014, we had 40 million unique users/month across 4 large (24 core) and 6 small (4 core) webservers, one large (24 core) SQL server, and a few utility servers - spread across 7 Sabey cabinets but could have squeezed into 3. We were paying $1500/month/cabinet, which included electricity and cooling but not Internet.","","p")

addElement("1007Bubble","Those servers tend to cost around $5000 each from Supermicro, so you're looking at $45k amortized across 5 years for $9000 per year or $750/month. Total $750 + $1k = $1750 per month to support 100 million unique users/month.","","p")

addElement("1007Bubble","When looking at taking this serverless, the first question is 'how many users are logging in?' This is usually much lower, so the first advice would be to store these files on S3 and accelerate. S3 Get fees would be around $1000/month, replacing the rack fees. Additionally S3 has a bandwidth fee that we'll omit in place of the omitted Internet circuit from an ISP. CloudFront allows the first 10 TB free and charges $0.85 per 10 TB after, so you'd be looking at around $2 to cover the 31.35 TB transferred as the 313k site is transferred 100 million times.","","p")
addElement("1007Bubble","This puts monthly fees around $1002 for the read-only users. Let's say there are 10 million unique writes per month, costing $20. Each write lasts 0.25 seconds, for a total of 2.5 million seconds of compute, at around $5.","","p")
