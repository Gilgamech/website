GPU is going to become a 4th peg on the 'Cloud stool', alongside traditional compute, memory, and storage. Right now, GPUs are relegated to peripheral status, like printers and USB drives. Most hypervisors allow one to be connected, but only at a cost of flexibility and convenience, tying the VM to the physical server. 

What's needed is for vGPU and GPU transport to become commonplace in virtualization. To be able to stream from an arbitrary hardware host to an arbitrary VM anywhere in the same data center. Right now it looks like only nViidia offer virtual GPUs - this is probably a result of their cloud-based remote gaming product. 

For GPU virtualization to become common, much larger data switches and routers will be needed to facilitate the huge data transfer. What's currently streamed through video cards will need to be streamed through network cables and over TOR switches instead. Can twisted pair keep up or will we all shift to fiber?
