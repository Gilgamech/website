## Daytime - Your turn
### Move around the game board - any location within your vehicle ruler. 
- Beanstalk has to be traversed to get from Earth to Moon and back - can only enter from Starport Kaguya on Moon, and The Root on Earth, and spend 1 time to move through each location (5 total). 
- Dropship Pass lets you travel anywhere on the board, even skipping the Beanstalk.
- Restricted Locations cost 3 time instead of 1, unless you have a warrant.
- Ritzy locations (diamond) let you draw 1 Light card & Seedy locations (triangle) let you draw 1 Dark card.
- 5 kinds of location, important for moving leads and some Twilight cards, but they don't affect movement in general.
### Investigate leads - either plant evidence, or a conspiracy puzzle piece.
**Everyone's guilty of something, right? What's it matter if they get punished for the wrong crime, so long as they get punished.**  
- 3 kinds of leads - testimony, physical, and document. 
- Detective has to be on a location with a lead. 
- Lead is moved when it's investigated, except during The Climax. 
- Player to the right rolls a d6 to see which district gets the lead, then moves it to another location of the same color - Religious (yellow), Civic (green), Residential (red), Business (blue), and Nightlife (purple) - that doesn't already have a lead. 
### Plant evidence    
- Player draws an Evidence Token, then plants it on any suspect.
- The Evidence Token must be planted on the matching area as the lead being investigated. (i.e. the Evidence Token from investigating a Physical lead must be planted on a Physical )  
- Evidence Tokens have a value from 5 to -4 - the suspect with the highest total is found guilty of the murder.
  - Players could strategically reduce one suspect's guilt, if the player would score more points with a different guilty suspect.
  - Different kinds of evidence impact different suspects differently - the lowest-value Strong evidence and highest value Weak evidence, for each suspect, are removed when scoring.
- Surprise Witness Tokens are -5.
- Perjury Tokens change Surprise Witness and Alibi tokens from -5 to +5.
### Build a Conspiracy puzzle    
  - Baggage (most), Favor (middle), Shift (least)   
- Plant Information   
  - Roll a d4 (reroll 1) to find what type of piece you get.
  - Use the benefit of the type of piece   
- Light/dark-shift someone  
- Get a normal favor  
- Place baggage  
  - Place the piece on the board.
  - Get the benefit of any bonus on the front of the piece. 
- FIngerprint - Add 1 physical evidence to the suspect of your choice.
- Skull - Add 1 strong evidence to the suspect of your choice.
- Bonus puzzle piece - go again.
- Jinteki / Haas link - add bonus Victory Points.
### Draw and play Twilight cards - Draw or discard any light or dark card, or play any light card.  
- Players may pay 1 time to discard any light or dark card in their hand, or draw their own light or any other player's dark card.
- Cards are usually only played on a player's turn - light cards played by them, and dark cards played by other players against them.
- Light cards cost 1 Time and 1 or more dark shifts to play.
- Dark cards cost 0 Time and 1 or more dark shifts to play, since they aren't played during your turn.
- Any other card may be discarded to subtract 1 light or dark shift from the cost, down to 0.
- Cards matching the plot color let you add or subtract 1 light or dark shift from the cost. 
### Get a jump on the case.  
- Claim "First Player"ship on the next turn.
### Use Location Abilities    
- Major Locations allow Favors to be exchanged for other items.
### Use Event Abilities    
- Some General and Specific events have abilites that may be used.

## Daytime - Other players' turns:
### Play dark cards against other players    
- One other player may play a Dark card against your detective during your turn.
- Some Dark cards can only be played when their detective enters a location -- any Dark card effects happen after the Ritzy/Seedy free card draw.
- Fight cards require the detective to light-shift or dark-shift.
- Only 1 player may play a Dark card per turn - so the First Player gets an opportuninty to play a Dark card first. The First Player can pass this opportuninty to the player on their right, who also gets to play a Dark card or pass to their right. If it's the First Player's turn, this starts with the player to their right instead.

## End of day:
### General Events, Specific Events, and Plots - Draw the top card and resolve, according to the calendar.
### First Player token gets passed to the last person to Get a jump on the case.  
### Events    
- New General Event bumps any current General Event to the 2nd space, and any 2nd General Event off the board, unresolved. 
- Resolved Events and "fall off the board" events go in the same face-down pile. 
- Specific events rearrange all the leads. 
  -  If a lead is already there, swap them. 
  -  If the suspect dies, the Specific Event ends and goes back in the box.
### Plots    
- Resolved in clockwise order, starting with the first player.
- Choose Your Own Adventure card game. 
- Enchantment that gathers good/bad baggage based on other game actions.
### Alibis, Surprise Witness, Perjury    
- Alibi tokens usually come from F8, are placed on a Suspect, to give them -5 Guilt. 
- Surprise Witness are also placed on a Suspect, to give them -5 Guilt. 
- Perjury are placed on a Suspect to reverse one Alibi or Surprise Witness token to +5 Guilt.

## Closing the Case
### Foreach Suspect:    
- Flip over all Evidence tokens, and remove the lowest-value Strong evidence and highest value Weak evidence.
- Match up a Perjury with a SW or Alibi token to reverse Guilt from -5 to +5.
- The suspect with the highest total is found guilty of the murder.
