				<h1>The past and future history of the modern world</h1>
				<h3>A puzzle whose pieces are spread across time and space.</h3>
				<h6>By one of the 21st century's greatest historians.</h6>
				<span class="popup">Definitions: (tap)<span style="text-align: left;">
				<p>This will be a perpetual work in progress. Found a typo, cringe, out-of-date entry, or want a specific event or video added? <a href="mailto:history@Gilgamech.com">Contact me</a>.</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Economics:</li><ul>
					<li>Ebidta: Earnings before interest, debt, taxes, and amortization.</li>
					<li>GilDollar: one year of economic activity for one average human, rounded down to 2021 equivalent $63,500. So 2021 equivalent $100,000 is 1.57 GD (100000/63500).</li>
					<li>GilCent: one working day of economic output, or 1/250 of one GilDollar, as 2021 equivalent $254. So 2021 equivalent $1270 is 5 GC.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Geography: </li><ul>
					<li>MegaAcre (MAcre): 1 million acres (4,046 km<sup>2</sup>, 1562.5 mi<sup>2</sup>, 0.4 MHectares). This measurement of area is somewhere between Rhode Island (1,045 mi<sup>2</sup> or 0.7 MAcres) and Delaware (1,954 mi<sup>2</sup> or 1.3 MAcres).</li>
					<li>MegaHectare (MHectare): 1 million hectares (10k km<sup>2</sup>, 3861 mi<sup>2</sup>, 2.5 MAcres). This measurement of area is slightly smaller than Kosovo (10.9k km<sup>2</sup>, 4.2k mi<sup>2</sup>, 1.1 MHectares, 2.7 MAcres).</li>
					<li>River rate: One CR = 7,500 m<sup>3</sup>/s (265,000 ft<sup>3</sup>/s) - this is the Columbia River's average flow rate.</li>
					<li>Titles: (Ocean, Sea, River, Mountain, etc) If it's in the 90th percentile for size or cultural significance, then the title goes before, otherwise it goes after.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Humans:</li><ul>
					<li>Name: JobTitle FirstName(# of their name) LastName [Translation] Titles/Epithets [Translation] (Country) - "Leader of the local human governance institution" is a job title.</li>
					<li>Person: A legal being, as recognized by a government.</li>
				</ul> 
				<li>Legends: stories of all kinds, from mythology to tradition to bedtime stories to major feature-length productions.</li>
				<li>Nation abbreviations:</li><ul>
					<li>DPR(N)Korea - The Democratic People's Republic of (North) Korea - is reunification just a dream?</li>
					<li>HREmpire, HREmperor, etc: Holy Roman Et cetera.</li>
					<li>NSGermany: National Socialism was a major disaster that resulted in millions of uninstalls. The existential crisis of this national movement was a fundamental insecurity about their equality with other humans, and this stems from the inherent ranking system that comes with an irrational obsession with arbitrary attributes.</li>
					<li>PRChina - 中国 (Zhōngguó) [Central Country] People's Republic of China holds the Yellow River Valley into the 21st century.</li>
					<li>ROChina - 中華 (Zhōnghuá) [Central Flower] Republic of China held the Yellow River Valley kinda between WW1 and WW2.</li>
					<li>RO(S)Korea - The Republic of (South) Korea - is reunification just a dream?</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Powers: Groups of humans which perform historical events and/or have an impact on other humans, and meet the following criteria. May also be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity">Polity</a>.</li>
				<ul>
						<li>Limited but functional government (maybe just one person)</li>
						<li>Well-defined boundaries, that may be highly mobile (i.e. geographical borders of the currently-inhabited area).</li>
						<li>Shared defense and resources.</li>
						<li>Common goals and mutual interest.</li>
					</ul>Examples:<ul>
					<li>Empire: Power large enough that one person alone cannot effectively provide goverance, and governmental power is split between several individuals.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Horizontal Empire: Split your state in half and give an ally full control over that half, but you're still friends.</li>
						<li>Vertical Empire: Get an ally to handle the day-to-day tasks while you focus on larger strategic matters.</li> 
						<li>Federation: Vertical empire with multiple allies split horizontally as peers.</li> 
						<li>Confederacy: Horizontal empire with a friendship club of leaders.</li> 
					</ul>
					<li>Micropower: Small or medium group of mobile humans, like a mobile nation or state.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Government is often one person or a small committee.</li>
						<li>Boundaries may be highly mobile.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<li>Square brackets [] contain translations.</li>
				<li>Temple - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple">from the Latin templum</a> - is a building reserved for spiritual rituals and activities such as prayer and sacrifice.</li>
				<li>Workdays: 250 days per year, from rounding down the 250.2422 working days in a year (365.2422 minus 104 weekend days and 11 holidays).</li>
				<li>Uninstall: We play Life on Super Hardcore Mode - it bans you from the server and deletes itself so you can't play again.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Covid-day is 8270 uninstalls, rounded from 5.58 million uninstalls in 675 days = 8267.</li>
						<li>Covid-rate is x/Covid-days uninstalls per day. For 1000 uninstalls per day, this is 12.09% Covid-rate.</li>
					</ul>

I'm realizing that I should sit this news cycle out, or it's going to exhaust me. Which is a perfect time to try taking a 2-week YouTube vacation that I had been thinking about. 
- Whenever we vacation these days, there's mobile signal almost everywhere, and resorts all have Wi-Fi, so while we change venues, we don't actually disconnect anymore.
- I'm going to try the reverse, keep working and stay where I am, but shut off a digital source for a little bit.
