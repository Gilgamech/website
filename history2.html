					<li>Ebidta: Earnings before interest, debt, taxes, and amortization.</li>
					<li>GilDollar: one year of economic activity for one average human, rounded down to 2021 equivalent $63,500. So 2021 equivalent $100,000 is 1.57 GD (100000/63500).</li>
					<li>GilCent: one working day of economic output, or 1/250 of one GilDollar, as 2021 equivalent $254. So 2021 equivalent $1270 is 5 GC.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Geography: </li><ul>
					<li>MegaAcre (MAcre): 1 million acres (4,046 km<sup>2</sup>, 1562.5 mi<sup>2</sup>, 0.4 MHectares). This measurement of area is somewhere between Rhode Island (1,045 mi<sup>2</sup> or 0.7 MAcres) and Delaware (1,954 mi<sup>2</sup> or 1.3 MAcres).</li>
					<li>MegaHectare (MHectare): 1 million hectares (10k km<sup>2</sup>, 3861 mi<sup>2</sup>, 2.5 MAcres). This measurement of area is slightly smaller than Kosovo (10.9k km<sup>2</sup>, 4.2k mi<sup>2</sup>, 1.1 MHectares, 2.7 MAcres).</li>
					<li>River rate: One CR = 7,500 m<sup>3</sup>/s (265,000 ft<sup>3</sup>/s) - this is the Columbia River's average flow rate.</li>

					<li>HREmpire, HREmperor, etc: Holy Roman Et cetera.</li>
					<li>NSGermany: National Socialism was a major disaster that resulted in millions of uninstalls. The existential crisis of this national movement was a fundamental insecurity about their equality with other humans, and this stems from the inherent ranking system that comes with an irrational obsession with arbitrary attributes.</li>
					<li>PRChina - 中国 (Zhōngguó) [Central Country] People's Republic of China holds the Yellow River Valley into the 21st century.</li>
					<li>ROChina - 中華 (Zhōnghuá) [Central Flower] Republic of China held the Yellow River Valley kinda between WW1 and WW2.</li>
