It was part of an extensive trade network, and imported obsidian from Cappadocia 170 km (105.6 mi) for processing into extremely sharp blades, and early polished mirrors.</p><p>Dwellings were a single room informally split in half. One side of the room was boring and full of grain in big stone or dried clay containers. (Pre-pottery - the process of baking clay hadn't been invented.) The other side was alive with home life, rituals based around hunting wild animals, and food prep - with a clay furnace and hearth directly underneath a dual-use roof hatch entrance, for furnace ventilation and also the ceiling ladder. As common decoration, two pair of bull horns set in plastered bunkers partitioning two sides of a ceremonial corner. Walls were painted with an alluvium plaster dug up from the lakebed, and many walls were painted with a humans-hunting-animals motif (possibly ritualistic) in red ochre. An especially iconic one has a bunch of people attacking a giant aurochs. (Proto-bull of heaven?) None of these motifs show any domesticated animals.</p><p>A dwelling would remain in use for decades, then be demolished through pulling out the roof supports, and a new dwelling built on the rubble. Archaeologists have found 18 layers of rebuilding with ultrasonic ground scans. Remains of the uninstalled have been found entombed under floors in various dwellings, and a common belief is that the constant plastering was an attempt to cover up the decay.</p><p>While Çatalhöyük's population was increasing, Cafer Hoyuk &amp; Aşıklı Höyük were seeing population declines, meaning people were probably moving from the lame old city to the cool new city.</p><p>The Konya plain receives little rainfall and the soil is poor quality. But the Carsamba river flows nearby, and would have flooded the city often with large amounts of nutrient-rich silt, which would have supported lots of Einkorn and Emmer wheat, grass for grazing animals, fish, nesting birds, and reeds for weaving. Also there are several forests nearby. (Why *on* the lakebed, and not *next to* the lakebed?)</p>"],

Except for in the morning, where a female slave brings to the eldest male fresh water, which he washes himself and spits and blows his nose into - then she takes this to the next eldest male, who does the same, through the household. They practice basically shintoism, leaving offerings to wood with a face carved or painted on it - sometimes a whole cow, and when wolves came to eat the cow, they would feel their spiritual lord was satisfied. Thiefs were vertically uninstalled from trees until the elements wore the bones bare.

There are 283k men listed, but clergy, women and chldren, and London are not counted - leading to an estimated English population of 2 million to 2.5 million.

From a brunch menu:<ol><h5>Pie Aloes of Beef:</h5><li>Aloes small meat rolls: Saute 1 bunch chopped parsley and ¾ cup (29 g) fresh chopped thyme leaves until wilted. Chop 6 large hard-boiled egg yolks and combine with wilted herbs, ⅓ cup raisins, ½ cup pitted and chopped dates, and season with kosher salt. Slice 1 boneless mutton leg into thin slices. Spread half of this egg yolk mixture onto the slices of mutton and roll up the parsley and thyme inside them.</li><li>Crust &amp; assembly: Whisk together 1.5 cups (350 g) flour and ½ tsp (3 g) kosher salt, then add 1 egg yolk and ¾ cup (154 g) melted lard and mix this together thoroughly. Add only enough hot water to knead into a smooth dough. Flatten into a circle between ⅛ and ¼ inch (3-6 mm) thick and about 17 in (43 cm) wide. Arrange the aloes in the center of the pie crust in a circular shape, leaving enough space to fold the edges over like a galette. Sprinkle a little sugar, cinnamon, saffron threads, &amp; salt on top of the aloes. Top with the remaining egg mixture. Bring the edges of the pie crust up around the aloes so that it forms pleats and leaves a hole at the top. Bake at 375 F (190 C) until done.</li><li>Syrup: In a small pot, break up 1 slice toasted white bread and add 1 cup (240 ml) white wine, ¾ cup (150 g) sugar, and 1 tsp (5 g) ground each cinnamon &amp; ginger. Simmer until the sugar is dissolved and the bread is mushy, and strain. Pour the syrup through the hole at the top of the pie after it’s done baking &amp; cooling.</li><h5>Ypocras Jelly (hippo-cras - a mulled wine set into jelly - aka wine jello shots):</h5><li>Gelatin: Add 2 calves feet, 1 veal shoulder, 1 gallon (3.8 L) both water and white wine to a large pot. (Feet and shoulder are great sources of gelatin, and veal is mild.) Cover and bring it to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer and partially cover. Gently simmer for 6 hours - skim off any scum that rises to the top. Strain and discard the solids. (This is basically a chemical extraction of the gelatin from the larger meat mass, using water as a solvent.)</li><li>Mulled wine: Add 2 tsps (10 g) ground cinnamon, 1 tsp (5 g) ground ginger, and 2 cups (300 g) sugar to the gelatin mixture and mix well.

This system is grounded in sympathy - a combination of empathy with the judgment and evaluation of others. Before this, people thought good things and bad things of all sizes happened because a deity made them happen. He gave the model that we're each independent players who react to what others do to us, not deity-controlled NPCs, and that society's morals should be based off this. And that we're all motivated by self-interest, where positive judgments in the sympathy give pleasure, and thus are in our self-interest.</p><p>To counter the criticism that selfish desires can harm others, Smith develops a Spectator within each person, who observes the person's behavior and others. That Spectator is who makes the judgments, against both ourselves and others. A crucial distinction Smith makes is between Justice (both social norms and actual laws) and Beneficence (being nice to people, holding doors, etc) - with beneficence but no justice, it's an untenably unjust society, while justice without beneficence is a livable-but-unpleasant society. This makes justice the most important moral foundation of society, and thus governments should enforce rules but not interfere with beneficence, as this might cause chilling effects.</p><p>Starting with humans as social beings, we strive for sympathy, tempered by the Spectator to be as impartial as possible. And we build social norms and laws around this impartiality, which was his vision for a free society of responsible people. </p><p>Beware the (Person) of System, he warned, who sees people as pieces on a chessboard - for they arrive with a vison in hand for a Perfect Order to Society. But people have their own laws of motion and aren't pieces on a chessboard. (Too often, this person's motivation is simple totalitarianism, where everyone else does what the person says or are punished.)</p>",],

Nevertheless, this was revolutionary for the time, and quickly led to others copying and improving on the design. (This was a steam engine small enough to have wheels attached and fit on rails. Previous designs used much larger stationary engines and long ropes.)"],

It reminded them of a huge incense burner. The upper part was made of red-coated rosewood with transparent windows, while the lower was covered in brazen plates. Inside was covered in text of an unknown language. Also inside were 2 bedsheets, 1 bottle with 3.5 L (0.92 gal) water, some cake, and kneaded (toughened) meat. Lastly there was a short beautiful woman of height 1.5 m (4.9 ft), with red hair and eyebrows, pale pink skin, and white hair extensions. Her clothes were smooth unknown fabrics. She didn't understand the fishermen, and they didn't understand her. She was polite but odd, clutching a quadrilateral box with sides of about 0.5 m (1.6 ft - this would have been 1/3 of her height) which she wouldn't let anyone touch. Recently, another woman with a similar box had washed up nearby, and also a board with a head pinned to it. So an elderly villager made up a legend that starts by disparaging her character and ends with her exiled to float in this boat with the head of a lover. Based on this new legend, they gathered the woman back into the ship and set her adrift again."],

The average difference between setting and reality was 11 feet (3.35 meters). Word of this got to (a supposedly notorious) Admiral King, who consulted the Bureau of Ordinance, after which they admitted the issues were known and testing was flawed. The Bureau of Ordinance had used very light dummy warheads, so the torpedoes would float after testing and be easy to collect. This meant they had to calibrate the torpedoes to aim much lower than with the heavier live warheads. The warhead was increased after this, and the depth sensors were installed in an area that would give false readings, causing the torpedo to go even lower. The depth sensor was a tricky one, since it was installed where the torpedo's shape causes a vortex as it moves through the water, which isn't detectable in a currentless bathtub.

(Japanese whale uninstallers would be bringing whale oil home as fuel for their war efforts.) Drop testing after this showed that angle hits were much more likely to trick the faulty contact detonators into firing, than direct hits. Ships were ordered to ignore their training and fire torpedoes at an angle, which gave a slight improvement in detonations. Further testing and deconstruction revealed the contact detonator's fire pin was 90 degrees from the direction of travel - if it were in the plane of travel, the impact would help it fire, but this way impact helped it jam. Often the torpedo's collision would smash its contact detonator before it could fire. Angled impacts gave slightly longer and slower impact, damaging the fragile detonator less and putting the line of travel closer to the firing pin's line of movement. This design flaw was in the previous generation, which traveled much slower, but the Bureau of Ordinance believed the same solution - a stronger spring - would continue to work with the faster torpedo. There was an additional issue common to all torpedoes, where a gyroscope might flip, causing the torpedo to flip and chase the ship which fired it - this caused at least 2 Allied ship losses during WW2."],

Some could not access benefits because they had not been given an honorable discharge—and a correlation of dishonorable discharge and increasing skin pigmentation, as though there were an irrational obsession with punishing people for producing high amounts of melanin.</p><p>The GI Bill created a massive influx of students, and institutions reacted to this glut in different ways. Southern colleges simply refused to matriculate any students who generated too much melanin, while Northern universities focused on low-melanin students. 95% of high-melanin veterans were shunted off to mostly-unaccredited Black colleges where they would compete for the few availabilities with students fresh from high school. The VA addressed this educational inequality by encouraging veterans to apply for vocational training instead of university admission, and arbitrarily denied educational benefits to some students. Vocational training programs were impacted by the same segregational policies as the rest of the education system, further limiting the learning opportunities for these individuals. Black veterans and civil rights groups protested their treatment, calling for protections like Black involvement in the VA and non-discriminatory loans, but the racial disparities in the implementation of the GI Bill had already been set into motion.</p><p>Of the more than 3,200 VA-guaranteed home loans across 13 Mississippi cities, banks turned away an estimated 318 customers purely due to their skin pigmentation. This afinancial nonsense wasn't limited to the South, notes historian Ira Katznelson, as in New York and northern New Jersey, banks again turned away an estimated 6,600 customers purely based on pigmentation. This forced these veterans to remain in cities that received less and less investment from businesses and banks. This was possible because the Veteran's Administration (VA) didn't have the funds to provide these loans, and so acted as cosigner on local bank loans. This allowed local banks to coordinate Redlining—a decades-old practice of marking maps by skin pigmentation or ancestry, to characterize the risks of lending money and providing insurance, thereby reducing the available housing supply to that group. Lenders banned customers from poorer neighborhoods, ensuring that they couldn't receive this government assistance.

The Clemenceau - a French aircraft carrier (and its retinue of 7 destroyers and 1 cruiser), was off the African west coast - just 3 days away. Brasil mobilized both navy and army. But this was the evening before Carnival, and a lot of sailors were on shore leave. Still, they assembled two forces:<ul><li>Cruiser Almirante Tamandaré and 4 destroyers. This cruiser had boiler problems which would take at least 15 days to repair, and so was eventually sidelined.</li><li>Cruiser Almirante Barroso, some destroyers, and 1 submarine. This force left later, and headed northeast. Barroso also had boiler problems, and could only run on half of her boilers. This cruiser also had several damaged main guns and no ammo for the working main guns. It had a total of 30 minutes of muntions, and their munitions depot could only resupply 20mm (78 caliber) guns.</li> </ul> <p>Brasil's navy didn't have their own tankers to resupply ships in combat, so leased one from Petrobras. And some of their ships weren't fit for combat. Nearly the whole fleet were refit WW2 ships bought from the USA, and their carrier Minas Gerais was the British exception, a venerable 22 years old. Damage and crew safety systems were in horrible condition on most ships. Brasil's helicopter-only air force was in somewhat better condition, with one modern class of helicopter.</p><p>France's navy were much more modern, with the Tartu being only 5 years old, and the Clemenceau was the baby-faced 3 years old &amp; capable of launching fixed-wing planes.</p><p>The Parana would find the Tartu the next day, and shadowed her for 3 days, when the Tartu tag-teamed with the aviso Paul Goffney, a much-less capable warship. Eventually more Brasilian ships were sent into the area.</p>"],

This allows the batteries in diesel submarines to be used less often, meaning the sub doesn't need to surface and run the diesel engines to charge its batteries as often. In the 1950s, AIP was used to increase speed, but in the 1980s it was used to increase stealth, as it extends the submerged duration from a couple days to a couple weeks. AIP *can* charge batteries, but the batteries have much more capacity - and since it's also a battery, it's more effiicient to just drive a generator.

Karen Meech (Institute for Astronomy in Hawaii) and her team combined images from the FORS instrument on the ESO telescope using four different filters with those of other large telescopes. She found that ‘Oumuamua varies in brightness by a factor of 10 as it spins on its axis every 7.3 hours, suggesting that it is up to one-quarter mile (1320 ft, 400 meters) long and up to 10 times as long as it is wide (as narrow as 132 ft or 40 m). That ratio is greater than that of any asteroid or comet observed to date - the most elongated we have seen less than 3x longer than wide.
